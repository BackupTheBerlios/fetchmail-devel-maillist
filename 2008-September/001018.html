<PRE>Hi Matthias,

Thank you for your warmhearted reply!

&gt;<i> congratulations on finishing the project. I haven't yet reviewed your code;
</I>&gt;<i> how about your availability for collaboration on code refinements should I
</I>&gt;<i> deem them helpful - could you work on that if issues arise during the merge?
</I>I've tried to limit the change made to fetchmail's original code as
few as possible. So I think it won't be too hard and I am confident
of resolving the issues:-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to the merge, the fetchmail trunk is currently out of date,
</I>&gt;<i> unmaintained and disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My tentative roadmap is as follows (but not fixed, I welcome any
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions for improvement)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - release 6.3.9 from BRANCH_6-3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Could you check (dry-run) if merging the BRANCH_6-3 changes since you
</I>&gt;<i>  copied that branch when forking BRANCH_MAPI is possible without major
</I>&gt;<i>  effort? If so, I'd appreciate if you could synch up with 6.3.9 before we
</I>&gt;<i>  try the merge-to-trunk effort.
</I>BRANCH_MAPI was synchronized up with BRANCH_6-3 now.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - merge BRANCH_6-3 into trunk and dub it 6.4.X for the nonce
</I>&gt;<i>  (this may mean to delete trunk and recreate it from BRANCH_6-3,
</I>&gt;<i>   and redo changes from the BRANCH_6-3 branch point to the point where
</I>&gt;<i>   trunk fell unmaintained - I'll see)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The manual page should at least contain pointers to README.mapi where
</I>&gt;<i>  adequate. Something like &quot;--protocol mapi&quot; (fill in whatever you chose):
</I>&gt;<i>  OpenChange support, see README.mapi for details.
</I>Could you have a look at the README.mapi and suggest which way is
better: merge it into manual or add some pointers to the README.mapi
at appropriate places in the manual?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - merge MAPI support into trunk, perhaps with code revisions as I review
</I>&gt;<i>  code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - perhaps clean up trunk, open ends for trunk (not all of them are needed
</I>&gt;<i>  for the merge):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  + sink.c is a mess. It does something like RTTI and under-the-hood
</I>&gt;<i>    behaviour switching for SMTP, LMTP and MDA. Now, with MAPI as fourth
</I>&gt;<i>    sink =&gt; eek. It needs abstraction, much like the &quot;--protocol&quot; feature.
</I>My code did not touch sink.c by now. If the abstraction will take
place, I will handle the MAPI part.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  + protocol vs. authenticator messup. KPOP (if it deserves to live) and
</I>&gt;<i>    APOP are by no means protocols, but are just POP3 authenticators.
</I>&gt;<i>    Probably unrelated to your work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  + SSL configuration is an intransparent mess, hard to understand, with
</I>&gt;<i>    several &quot;automatic&quot;s under the hood, that I'd like to clean up.
</I>&gt;<i>    Requires changing rcfile format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Does MAPI require SSL support in fetchmail?
</I>&gt;<i>    If not, it's independent of your work.
</I>SSL is not needed by MAPI. I've write code to bypass the SSL settings
if users configure SSL for MAPI.

Best regards!
Yangyan
