<PRE>I am experiencing similar problems reported in March by Anthony Kim. See 
old thread here:
<A HREF="http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/fetchmail-friends/2006-March/010015.html">http://lists.ccil.org/pipermail/fetchmail-friends/2006-March/010015.html</A>

In this case, I'm using fetchmail 6.4.3 with and without Debian patches, 
and am subjected to Lotus 6.5.4.

Anthony's fix (changing the Lotus mail format) does not work in our 
configuration. In fact, the &quot;Keep in Sender's format&quot; is still the 
default here for all users. We see mutilated emails regularly. They are 
generally from the Lotus webmail system or Lotus notes. Attachments from 
those are almost always mangled. Internet emails are seldom broken.

We have seen the Content-Transfer-Encoding and Content-Type headers not 
reported by the server in response to the FETCH RFC822.HEADER command. 
The server also tends to report bogus header sizes, although that didn't 
seem to phase fetchmail.

I've done a few hours hacking away at the server and fetchmail and can 
only conclude that separate header and body retrieval must be abandoned 
for the very broken actions of Lotus. In digging through fetchmail, it 
appears that the only way to &quot;cleanly&quot; (I use that loosely) accomplish 
this is to make a new protocol. &quot;LotusIMAP&quot; maybe?

I did manage a very quick and very very ugly hack to accomplish this, 
and it now works! I can finally abandon my bastardization MDA that 
attempts to figure out what those headers should be and add them. As you 
can guess, that approach didn't work very well.

Some mention was made in the old thread to adding the single retrieval 
as an option. Is there an easy way to do that? I do have time to provide 
small modifications.

Thanks!
Jason
