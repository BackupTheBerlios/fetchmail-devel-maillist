<PRE>&gt;<i> Heck, can't vendors be bothered to repair the known defects in their
</I>&gt;<i> software or at least sponsor workarounds in third-party software they
</I>&gt;<i> are breaking?
</I>
Agreed. Of course, if I had a say (or if any of my fellow 80,000 minions 
had a say) we'd not be using Lotus.

&gt;<i> Some alternatives to FETCH 1234 RFC822.HEADER (where 1234 is the message
</I>&gt;<i> number) I could think of:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   BODY.PEEK[HEADER]
</I>Still missing fields.

&gt;<i>   BODY.PEEK[MIME]   - nonstandard, may cause BAD reply
</I>BAD Invalid Fetch argument body.peek[mime]

&gt;<i>   BODY.PEEK[0.MIME] - nonstandard, may cause BAD reply
</I>BAD Invalid Fetch argument body.peek[o.mime]

&gt;<i>   BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS (MIME-Version Content-Type Content-Transfer-Encoding Content-Disposition)]
</I>This returned the fields, although only the Content-Transfer-Encoding 
was missing from the RFC822 header output.

&gt;<i>   BODY.PEEK[HEADER.FIELDS.NOT (foo)]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does any of these provide you with the full header when RFC822.HEADER is
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   FETCH 1 BODYSTRUCTURE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> give you (replace 1 by the number of a 'broken' message)?
</I>
* 574 FETCH (BODYSTRUCTURE (&quot;text&quot; &quot;html&quot;  (&quot;charset&quot; &quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;) NIL 
NIL &quot;quoted-printable&quot; 1287 22 NIL NIL NIL))
I don't know how to parse this output, although the strings presented 
are correct. Don't know what the numbers are supposed to reflect.


&gt;<i> A full IMAP4r1 session might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A LOGIN USER SECRETPASSWORDGOESHERE
</I>&gt;<i> B SELECT INBOX
</I>&gt;<i> C FETCH 1 BODY.PEEK[HEADER]
</I>&gt;<i> D LOGOUT
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Generally, fetchmail has support for protocols that can only retrieve
</I>&gt;<i> full messages (POP3, for instance, uses that), so some hacking away at
</I>&gt;<i> imap.c might be sufficient to make the rest of fetchmail believe that
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP could only support full messages. The protocol interface is OOP
</I>&gt;<i> style (yes it's clumsy in C, but it works), in that driver.c/transact.c
</I>&gt;<i> call protocol (imap.c/pop3.c) methods^Wfunctions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best would be a workaround that could automatically kick in, since
</I>&gt;<i> that's easiest for users and distributors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such code might require minor internal rearrangements, such as moving
</I>&gt;<i> what used to be hard-wired protocol attributes into methods that query
</I>&gt;<i> the capabilities of the current connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I've used structs of function pointers to do similar things in the past. 
Few surprises in that area. =)
Sadly, I didn't manage to do an imap isolated patch yesterday. To get my 
hack to work, I mutilated imap.c to make the getsizes, getpartialsizes 
and fetch body NULL and changed fetch_headers to submit FETCH %d 
(BODY[]). I also had to change driver.c by adding len-=msgblk.msglen 
before the readbody. Otherwise, it'd try to read the whole message size 
off of the socket. I was very confused by the last bit, as it seemed 
that changing the fetch body to NULL should've induced driver.c to do 
the same to handle the POP protocols. I expect I missed something somewhere.

Is there a way to identify an imap server? The banner on login only states:
* OK IMAP Server Ready Tue, 8 Aug 2006 08:37:04 -0500


Thanks!
Jason
