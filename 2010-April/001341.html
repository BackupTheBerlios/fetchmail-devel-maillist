</I>&gt;<i> You can download this as tarball, but you still need to follow the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It contains a lightweight version of your patch (see the two latest
</I>&gt;<i> commits). The fastuidl fix is less efficient, but also less needed since
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of UIDs added is ld N there, so we get O(n log n) complexity
</I>&gt;<i> for parsing the UIDL responses. The UIDL fix is O(n) for the actual
</I>&gt;<i> insertion, but remains O(n^2) for &quot;message seen yet?&quot; detection.
</I>
This looks very suspiciously like my first attempt at making a 'quick'
improvement to this code. It will yield about half of the benefit of
the patch I sent (for 'our' application), because this method cannot
be used for the fastuidl path in pop3_is_old (as you wrote, I profiled
this before making the more complicated change). It is also (sorry for
being so blunt) not very well done. Because of the

    /* do it nonrecursively so the list is in the right order */
    for (end = idl; *end; end = &amp;(*end)-&gt;next)
        continue;

in save_str_quick, the value passed to the routine should be the
address of the pointer which needs to be changed when appending to the
list, eg, assuming the 'savep' change:

---------
int ok;
unsigned int first_nr, last_nr, try_nr;
char id [IDLEN+1];
struct idlist *savep = NULL; /** pointer to cache save_str result, speeds up saves */
first_nr = 0;
last_nr = count + 1;

[...]

last_nr = try_nr;
/* save it */
savep = save_str(savep ? &amp;savep : &amp;ctl-&gt;oldsaved, id, UID_UNSEEN);
savep-&gt;val.status.num = try_nr;
---------

a better implementation would be

--------------------------
int ok;
unsigned int first_nr, last_nr, try_nr;
char id [IDLEN+1];
struct idlist **svp, *sv;
first_nr = 0;
last_nr = count + 1;
svp = &amp;ctl-&gt;oldsaved;

[...]

last_nr = try_nr;
/* save it */
sv = save_str(svp, id, UID_UNSEEN);
sv-&gt;val.status.num = try_nr;
svp = &amp;sv-&gt;next;
---------------------------

which has the nice bonus property that it doesn't have the conditional
which goes one way during the first iteration and the other way during
all that follow inside the loop (the idea isn't mine, I originally
learnt about it because of some years-old USENET posting of a guy
whose name I've unfortunately forgotten). I am also rather concerned
about use of bandwidth than speed. Presently, I am dealing with 76
POP3 accounts and about a meg of stored UIDs I'd need to download
every five minutes in order to determine that presently, nothing needs
to be downloaded (this refers to fastuidl in general, assuming I
understood the principle correctly without really analyzing the code).

So, thank you very much for your effort, but I'll stick with the
version in the private fork I am anyway maintaining because of the
additional features (like 'object-oriented/ vtabled sinks') whose
usefulness would be very limited outside this particular
application and/or whose implementation is rather 'commercial' (eg
#ifdefing away the concurrency control code) than aesthetically/
technically pleasing. The savedend-change was just something I
considered to be more generally useful, hence I 'backported' it to
6.3.16 from my HEAD and sent it to the list.

BTW, I had a look at the UIDL patch and whoever wrote that should
probably spend some time reading RFC4549 (Synchronization Operations
for Disconnected IMAP4 Clients) which is what I am going to add to the
imap-code because using the \Seen flag as 'message is old' indicator
[reportedly] interferes with the gmail web interface.

NB: Nothing of this text is meant as an insult even if it may sound
like one. I am a computer person and not a person person and my
knowledge regarding 'how to deal with other human beings' is still
very limited, not the least because 'other human beings' are usually
drunk, male persons desiring to hit me because I have (again) done
something wrongly I neither understood nor recognized.
