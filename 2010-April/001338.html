Hi Rainer,

thanks for the analysis.  You've bumped into a (known) design flaw of  
fetchmail's UID handling.  It has been on the TODO list for ~2 years, but  
since it's not a functional bug, the bug fixes always got priority.

Basically the whole uid.c outfit is using the wrong data structures for  
its purpose. The whole stuff - I guess you figured as much - is meant to  
figure if a certain UID was seen, i. e. is in a set or not, and read/write  
that set from/to disk. We don't need order, only uniqueness, but we do  
need quick access, and the size is dynamic.

uid.c currently uses a linear list of n elements, and iterates over it  
roughly 1.5n times, i. e. we get O(n^2) complexity (without constant  
factors).

Your patch, albeit it helps a bit in that it shaves save_str down to O(n),  
does not fix the fundamental complexity problem: the id_find() stuff and  
with it the whole UID setup, still remains O(n^2) the way we're using it,  
only reduced by a constant factor of, guessing optimistially, 2-3.

I have some ideas for a proper solution:

(a) blunt: instead of the list, use an array with realloc, qsort and  
bsearch.  Ugly, but probably portable to anything that can compile  
fetchmail today.

(b) halfway: depend on &lt;search.h&gt;, use tsearch(3).  Not the ultimate in  
performance, but easy to use and down to O(n log n) complexity, which  
helps quite a bit already.  (hcreate(3) has a fixed size and supports only  
one table per process, which are showstoppers.)  Deemed safe for fetchmail  
6.3.

Even better options:

(c) Use C++ and optionally Boost with unordered_set. Fallback options are  
hash_set and set. Recent 6.3 versions are already intelligible as C and  
C++, so it's a gradual move with one initial bump that pulls in the  
dependencies and switches to C++.

(d) use a disk-based hashed or btree database.  I don't know the optimal  
library though, I've been through this in bogofilter.  sqlite3 pulls in  
SQL overhead (it's not that bad, but still) we don't need, but otherwise  
quite robust. Berkeley DB has decent documentation, STL API and is bullet  
proof -- but there are two nukes that kill it: (1) users messing with the  
files and removing log files, (2) distributions upgrading libdb and  
application without telling the user. It's also a nightmare to  
autodetect.  TokyoCabinet might be a candidate, but its API is pretty raw  
on the bits and I trust its future less than all other databases.


I am very inclined to go for (c) or (d) in fetchmail 6.4 and I think I'm  
determined to go for C++ as that allows much conciser code.

I am loathe to change 6.3 uid.c at all, as basically it's beyond repair  
and needs to be redone from scratch - which is not adequate for a &quot;stable&quot;  
version.

6.4 should split .fetchids to per-account files (we used to have patches  
but never deployed them in baseline code), which greatly simplifies uid  
list handling. See patches at &lt;<A HREF="http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/">http://home.pages.de/~mandree/fetchmail/</A>&gt;.

&gt;<i> I am aware that the 'split append' (save_str + explicit adjustment of
</I>&gt;<i> savedend-pointer) isn't exactly beautiful but it is a reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> simple change with a significant positive impact for POP3 mailboxes
</I>&gt;<i> containing lots of ('kept on server') messages.
</I>
If a constant factor of - best case guess - 3 is &quot;significant&quot;, then yes -  
but it still doesn't scale and your gain is lost again if you increase the  
number of messages by 40 - 80 %.

The moment I saw your patch I immediately thought of AmigaOS (Kickstart)  
exec.library &quot;struct List&quot; and &quot;struct Node&quot; (AROS equivalent at [1])  
which would solve this problem in a beautiful way -- albeit without fixing  
the fundamental performance problem.

I hope you're not too disappointed that I'm loathe to take your patch and  
that you can understand my reasoning.

Best regards
Matthias
