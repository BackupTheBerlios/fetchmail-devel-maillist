&gt;<i> first i'd like to note that i am not a mapi specialist.. or anything

</I>
No need to justify your goals - your input and observations are useful and  
welcome, even if you cannot provide full solutions to issues that you see.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3. missing mapi_session* argument
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	affected functions are mapi_init, smtp_address
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	(calls OpenMsgStore, GetGALTable)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	i had to introduce static global variable for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you can find a patch in the attachment. this way it at least compiles  
</I>&gt;<i> and runs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the things is: if i use s_mapi_session everywhere it stops to work  
</I>&gt;<i> properly in mapi_getauth (MapiLogonProvider creates another session and  
</I>&gt;<i> if the
</I>&gt;<i> s_mapi_session passed as arg, it crashes later in ProcessNetworkProfile)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so the s_mapi_session is shared only between mapi_init and smptp_address  
</I>&gt;<i> for a moment.
</I>
I'll save this part and look at it later; perhaps Jelmer can help here.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4. buffer overflows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	affected functions get_base64_attachment, octool_get_stream
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 	perhaps all these memcpys should be reviewed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i will toy with this few days until i figure what the correct form  
</I>&gt;<i> should be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> as a hotfix i simply allocated lot of memory and removed the loop that  
</I>&gt;<i> did nothing. i assume you do not want that kind of solution (and neither  
</I>&gt;<i> do i.. in long term)
</I>
Ah, ok.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 6. \r characters and = spread all around in mail body
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is this quoted_printable_encode part doing wrong? Could you provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your solution to (6)? Perhaps we can build a full solution on top of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> errr.. do not overestimate me... i simply removed the code that did not
</I>&gt;<i> suited me ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	for example: what is this supposed to do? 8-&gt;7 bit?
</I>&gt;<i> 			if (is_safe_char(ch))
</I>&gt;<i> 				line[line_count++] = ch;
</I>&gt;<i> 			else {
</I>&gt;<i> 				line[line_count++] = '=';
</I>&gt;<i> 				line[line_count++] = hex[(ch &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; 15];
</I>&gt;<i> 				line[line_count++] = hex[ch &amp; 15];
</I>&gt;<i> 			}
</I>
This looks like quoted printable encoding to me. hex is likely (i. e. I  
haven't looked at the code) a char array &quot;0123456789ABCDEF&quot; and if it's a  
safe character (no control character), it's emitted directly, otherwise,  
it's encoded as =XX, where XX is the associated ASCII value, expressed as  
a sedecimal number.

&gt;<i> 	if yes i wonder why mutt (set noallow_8bit) displays that incorrectly.
</I>
Perhaps headers do not properly declare content. Do you have an example of  
such a message (inside mutt, just pipe it into &quot;cat - &gt;/tmp/msg.bin&quot;, then  
mail msg.bin as application/octet-stream attachment).

&gt;<i> 	and then there are these line[line_count++] = '\r';
</I>&gt;<i> 	which are later visible in mutt.
</I>
If that's correct depends on the location in the code where you've found  
this.

&gt;<i> 	sincerely, i have no idea what proper solution should look like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there are more problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 	- fetchmail modifies the &quot;From: &quot; header
</I>&gt;<i> 	- fetchmail seems to drop any list-id and in-reply-to fields (and  
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> 	  other fields). this makes mailing lists (and threading) a little bit
</I>&gt;<i> 	  uncomfortable
</I>
Is it fetchmail or OpenChange or Exchange that does this?

I recall an internship some 8 years ago where the company also Exchange  
(that was in early 2001), and Emacs+Gnus was rather confused by the output  
(which also included blank lines in places where you didn't expect them,  
and where PINE didn't show them), while PINE worked reasonably well. I  
don't recall how well mutt fared at the time.
