<PRE>Hi,

This is my first post on this list (hopefully not a too bad one).

I think my post is a development issue (more exactly, a request), but if 
this is a user issue, please send me to the correct place.

I wrote a Perl tool to create semi automatic configuration for fetchmail 
(This is in a particular context : It's a contribution for SME server. 
SME server is a Prepackaged Linux distribution mainly build for Small 
and Medium Enterprise -hence the name. More here : <A HREF="http://www.contribs.org">http://www.contribs.org</A>).
My mail was not here to explain SME server, just an introduction !

SME use qmail as mail daemon, and the last version use qpsmtpd as front 
end, with some anti Spam stuff activated by default. With this 
configuration, we encounter big troubles with mail locally refused and 
fetchmail.

Let's suppose a distant mail contains a virus. Fetchmail try to get the 
mail, and to drop it to the local mailserver.
qpsmtpd in turn, does all it's security check, and, because of the 
virus, send a 552 error.
fetchmail understand that, and then try to inform the sender (because of 
the bounce option), by a reject mail.
The 'From:' field is in the form : FETCHMAIL-DAEMON@{system fqdn}
But the FQDN of the computer is not known on public DNS server, and 
qpsmtpd refuse the incoming mail because of that.
(Sorry for this very long explanation, but I didn't find any reference 
to this trouble in the user and devel mail list).

Here my question : could it be possible to construct the return address 
in the form : FETCHMAIL-DAEMON@{ fetchmail smtpaddress } ?
or maybe to have a new parameter like fetchadmin
(or for the best, the two) ?

I really would have proposed a patch at least for the first option  but 
i simply cannot write C...

Many thanks in advance,
