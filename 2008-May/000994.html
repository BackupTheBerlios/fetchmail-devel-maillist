Hi Jelmer, Yangyan, *,

I have contacted Carl Harris Jr (the popclient author, popclient is
fetchmail's predecessor, some lines of code remain in fetchmail) and
Eric S. Raymond (who extended and maintained fetchmail for a long time)
yesterday.

Carl considers GPLv3 compatible with his original distribution terms.

Eric lets me choose what suits the project best from &quot;any version of
GPL&quot;, &quot;GPL v2 or later&quot;, and &quot;GPL v2 only&quot;, so I guess I'll turn it into
a &quot;GPL v2, or, at your option, any later version of the GPL&quot; for the
nonce, and later review if fetchmail as a whole should move on to GPL v3
or perhaps AGPL v3 - that would require a new license review.

I'll have to check if any code pieces remain that are GPLv2 only or
otherwise incompatible, or require consent of the authors to change to
&quot;any later version&quot; or similar; however, as I expect these to be minor,
I'm ready to drop or rewrite them if need be.

I expect the MAPI support to become part of a later fetchmail version
I'll dub 6.4 or 7.0 depending on the extent of other changes, so we have
the opportunity for a bigger cleanup anyways, and we should take it (for
instance, drop POP2 support).

WRT the MAPI code itself, I'd very much appreciate if it could be kept
in separate .c/.h/... files with as little changes to other files as
possible (for instance, don't hack too much on sink.c, but add a
sink-mapi.c file and just add the hooks to sink.c you need while
testing, and we'll in a team effort then split sink.c into sink.c,
sink-smtp.c (perhaps sink-lmtp.c), and sink-mda.c, and add your
sink-mapi.c.

HTH,
