I thought I saw something about downloads hanging because they contained a
null (\0) character. That would be different.

In the event of any dispute about whether it's fetchmail's fault or the
server's, then I'd say the best thing to do is to get a
    tcpdump -i eth0 -n -s1500 -X tcp port 110
output, and see exactly what is going on.

&gt;<i> &gt; qmail-pop3d gives a wrong size because it doesn't count end-of-line as two

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lines which start with the termination character use byte-stuffing but don't

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That could be compensated for as the message is read, because it is read
</I>&gt;<i> line-wise.
</I>
But if you're going to read the mail line-by-line then you can just as
easily check for the CR LF . CR LF termination sequence!

I can't imagine that any other major POP3 client does anything other than
that, and I don't see why fetchmail should.

Regards,

Brian.
