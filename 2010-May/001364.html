</I>
I do. IMAP UIDs are defined to be strictly monotonically increasing
unsigned 32 bit numbers (eventual wrap-around to be signalled via
UIDVAILDITY change) and for the application I need this for, it is ok
to not apply 'policy changes' (such as a changed size limit)
retroactively. This means that I basically just record the highest
'seen' UID + 1 and then do a SEARCH UID &lt;recorded&gt;:&lt;UIDNEXT&gt; to get
information about yet 'unseen' mails. 

[UIDL database improvements]

&gt;<i> - to make sure that your employer either waives his copyright and allows you to

</I>
I have no spare time :-&gt; (almost literally). But the business of my employer
is mostly to sell services and not software and the usual answer
whenever I asked for something like this in the past was 'sure'. 

[...]

&gt;<i> I have plans to attack POP3/UIDL scalability myself soon -- I could
</I>&gt;<i> devote my time in other ways if I know your work covers that and
</I>&gt;<i> reduces complexity to O(n log n) worst-case.
</I>
I actually started to write some code for this. So far, I was planning
to use two vectors to be able to access records either by position or
by 'associated fetch number' and to do ID searches based on a PATRICIA
trie (reasonably easy to implement and I've already done a few in the
past). This would imply that searching for a string of n characters
would, at worst, need n * 8 single bit tests[*] (and a final complete
comparison). Based on my present oprofile numbers[**] (based on 101
.fetchids files with an average length of ~303 lines), the time spent
with loading the file data is IMHO not large enough to warrant using a
disk-based database (and this would be complicated because of the need
to be able to find 'UIDL records' based on three different critetria).

I could probably devote at least an hour of (unpaid) overtime to this
per day, meaning, a usable implementation should be available at the
end of this week or the beginning of next week.

	[*] Current SUS versions actually mandate eight bit bytes.
        
        [**] I am attaching a complete opreport -l output for
        reference.
