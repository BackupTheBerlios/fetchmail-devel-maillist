Hi Rainer,

this looks good.  Without trying to downplay your efforts, I'd also say  
that this was somewhat expected. In other words, your numbers confirm that  
the trie works as expected and does not degenerate into a linear list in  
your test cases.
   Insertion into the data structure is fastest for a pre-allocated array,  
then appending to a list that has a tail pointer. Inserting into trees,  
tries, heaps, and thereabouts always takes a bit longer because it  
encloses a search for the node where you'll be forking the branches. It is  
some sort of &quot;ordered&quot; insertion. This is the price we (happily!) pay for  
quicker retrievals and searches.

The important part here is that, given N UIDs in a list, the costly  
operations &quot;insert all UIDs&quot; and &quot;for each UID retrieved from the server,  
check if we've already seen it&quot; are reduced to O(N log N) when they used  
to cost O(N^2) for larger N (i. e. asymptotically).

I'm really looking forward to your code :-)

Best regards
