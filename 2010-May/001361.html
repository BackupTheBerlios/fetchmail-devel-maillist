I am done with my last 'firebrigade' assignment which means that I
will now continue to work on the UID support for imap (which is
presently at the state that it uses UIDNEXT to detect new mails while
still using \Seen for determining their message sequence numbers and
to distinguish between old and new mails). The UID code isn't really
suitable for public consumption and won't become this without a major
additional effort (and given that my regular worktime is presently
around 53 hours/week, I won't have the time to do that). I will also
hopefully be able to get rid of the linked-list representation for the
POP3 UIDL database at latest until end of June (I hope), possibly
earlier, and I would be willing to base this on a 'public'
fetchmail-tree and share it if their was any interest in that (I am
also supposed to work on a completely different project which is
supposed to be demoed in June, but I think that I will be able to
interleave both).
