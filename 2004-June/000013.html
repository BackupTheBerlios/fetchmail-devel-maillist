That was my plan. When I import the Debian source tree I can start
looking at the differences.

&gt;<i> I wonder if the Debian directory should also be here if that made
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>
The general consensus among other developers is that doing so is not a
good idea, since fixes only to the Debian directory might require new
releases. Also, those downloading the tarball, or checking out a copy
from CVS would have a Debian directory that they wouldn't be interested
in.

Additionally, I might (for some reason or other) need to patch the
fetchmail source tree in a way that only affects Debian, and I wouldn't
want to have to put the patch in the trunk.
