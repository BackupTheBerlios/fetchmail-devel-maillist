I'm no autotools expert, so I'm not sure whether it's better to have 
separate m4 files or a single one.  My intuition says separate though.

I definitely agree with your assessment about whether to use the 
subdirectory.  :-)

I understand how you feel.  The main reason I didn't push the branch was 
that Matthias was testing on three different OSs, and the non-automake 
version wouldn't build on at least one of them.  (Though admittedly 
another factor was that I was on my way out for vacation.)

&gt;<i> For 6.2.6, I think we need to get the repository looking as close to
</I>&gt;<i> esr's 6.2.5 tarball, plus the patches we have talked about.
</I>
We need to do extensive changes to the release scripts anyway, which 
touches the build system, so I'm not too concerned about making changes to 
the build system.

On the other hand, I want to minimize changes to the fetchmail code itself 
(i.e. C code) until after 6.2.6.
