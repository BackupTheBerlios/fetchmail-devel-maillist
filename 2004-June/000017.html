You must admit, though, that that's a bit of an ugly hack.

&gt;<i> &gt; The config language is a nightmare, and pretty illogical (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; settings which I think should be settable globally and inherited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by all accounts, like 'ssl' for example, aren't; and working out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which settings apply to hosts and which to users has had me

</I>&gt;<i> I haven't been reduced to digging in the source, but have had some

</I>
Yeah, one big thing that we need to do is fix the documentation to separate 
the categories of settings.

Ideally I'd love to figure out a way to fix the config language to make 
this more explicit, but that has a lot of problems.  Fixing the docs would 
go a long way.

&gt;<i> &gt; To be fair to fetchmail, in the olden days it *did* offer direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to mailbox delivery, and it was ESR's decision that the design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be made much cleaner by having delivery to a local SMTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; daemon instead. Then slowly, things crept back in like delivery
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; via a pipe to procmail, delivery by invoking an MTA command-line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly, delivery by LMTP... but things I *actually* want, like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delivery to a Maildir, aren't there.
</I>
You could have procmail deliver to a maildir.

&gt;<i> As long as we have the ability to hand off to a specified agent,
</I>&gt;<i> I would think it preferable -- at least, more modular -- to use a
</I>&gt;<i> different external agent for each type of local mail store, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than to try to amalgamate the lot of them into fetchmail.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> have fetchmail invoke the same local delivery program that sendmail
</I>&gt;<i> would use to write to a maildir.
</I>
True.  On the other hand....
ESR would hate the idea, but I actually think that maildir is a decent 
candidate for inclusion because it doesn't have the locking headaches that 
other formats have.

Of course, I was the one who successfully fought to get mda support put 
back into fetchmail after ESR removed it way back when.
