<PRE>Thanks to Eric Raymond's cooperation, I've been able to load the fetchmail 
code into a Subversion repository at berlios.de, complete with his 
revision history going from the 1996 popclient days up to what he was 
about to release as fetchmail 6.2.6.

The berlios project page is:
  <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fetchmail/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/fetchmail/</A>
Information about accessing the Subversion repository is at:
  <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=1824">http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=1824</A>

There are some caveats about the code repository.

1. There were some files in Eric's tarball that were not under version 
control, and I tried to add the ones that were necessary without adding 
any generated files, but there may be a few extraneous or missing files.
2. Eric's torturetest script depends on a list of test servers that I've 
omitted from the repository since it has account passwords that should not 
be made public.  We'll need to figure out a way to deal with this.
3. Eric's release scripts include lots of things that were intended for his 
environment but will not work at all in the new environment.  This is the 
first thing that will need to be fixed.  After this is fixed, we should be 
about ready for a 6.2.6 release.


I've also set up new mailing lists at berlios.org:
fetchmail-announce
fetchmail-users
fetchmail-devel
fetchmail-svn

I've also requested the fetchmail-friends and fetchmail-announce email 
address lists from ccil.org, but had no reponse yet other than a promise 
to send them &quot;later today&quot; (which was almost a week ago). I still have 
hope, and have sent a reminder.


Oh, we'll also need to set up a web page, which will be at 
<A HREF="http://fetchmail.berlios.de/.">http://fetchmail.berlios.de/.</A>  Eric's old web page would be a good 
starting point, but would need editing.  It would be nice if we could have 
that done for the 6.2.6 release.
