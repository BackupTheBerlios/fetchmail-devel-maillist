Well, &quot;user&quot; is as opposed to &quot;server&quot;, and was referring to fetchmail
rcfile syntax.  What I actually mean is that it's specific to the
upstream server's user, or account.

You should be able to go about something like (untested fragment!):

#------------------------------------------
# one server with two accounts to be polled
poll someserver.example.org proto pop3 uidl
user john pass 123 is joe.sixpack mda &quot;/my/fancy/script john&quot; ssl
user jack pass 456 is joe.sixpack here mda &quot;/my/fancy/script jack&quot; ssl
#...

poll otherimaptoaster.example proto imap
user joe pass &quot;really@ strange!password&quot; is joe.sixpack here
mda &quot;/my/fancy/script <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">joe at other</A>&quot;
#------------------------------------------

Would that work for you?  All three accounts from two servers map to the
same local user, but have a distinct mda option, so I hope this meets
your needs.

&gt;<i> P.S. I apologize for the misleading Subject line I used to start this
</I>&gt;<i> thread. When I started writing my message to the list, I was thinking in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of modifying fetchmail to allow arbitrary headers to be added to
</I>&gt;<i> messages before delivery, but my thinking evolved as I wrote the message
</I>&gt;<i> and I obviously ended up proposing something different, but I forgot to
</I>&gt;<i> go back and update the Subject. I'm not going to change the Subject line
</I>&gt;<i> now, though, because that would just confuse everybody's threading. :-)
</I>
Would it really?  I rely on In-Reply-To: and References: headers for
threading...

But generally I'm open to provide filtering through an external command
should the need arise, possibly combined with decisions as to the
transient/permanent error or deliver or drop-silently.  I'm not sure
that it needs to be more specific like that because there are tools like
maildrop's reformail that can modify message headers.
