<PRE>&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">fetchmail-friends-admin at lists.ccil.org</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> [mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">fetchmail-friends-admin at lists.ccil.org</A>] On Behalf Of Gary Sims
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly the return-path is broken, it looks like the 
</I>&gt;<i> Received: header has been 
</I>&gt;<i> pasted on the end. I would guess a memory corruption 
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere as the closing 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&gt;&quot; is missing which would imply something is being 
</I>&gt;<i> overwritten by something else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, the question now remains, is it my ISP's mail server 
</I>&gt;<i> which is broken 
</I>&gt;<i> or is it fetchmail in its fetching of the mail by POP3.
</I>
Unlikely to be fetchmail (but not impossible).  The address is stored in a
buffer defined as being BUFSIZ characters long.  This is an OS define.  On my
Mandrake 9.1 box it's defined by stdio.h as being _IO_BUFSIZ.  That appears to
be defined by libio.h as _G_BUFSIZ which appears to be defined by _G_config.h
as 8192.  Even a very long email address should be less than 8191 bytes :)

It could be some bizarre bug (so I've CCd to the -devel list so that the
experts can have a look) that's causing a lack of truncation only for really
long addresses (or possibly ones where the terminating &gt; is missing), but the
fact that you're the only person to report it (so far anyway) makes me suspect
a cause elsewhere.

One test might be to hack rfc822.c such that at each invocation of nxtaddr()
it sets all bytes in address[] to be NULL.  Of course, you'll need to get a
hold of a known broken email to test with :(
 
&gt;<i> IMHO, I don't actually agree. The mail message was on a POP3 
</I>&gt;<i> server somewhere 
</I>&gt;<i> which means it has gone through some sort of processing and 
</I>&gt;<i> has arrived. The 
</I>&gt;<i> local delivery failed and the NDN failed. In my opinion this 
</I>&gt;<i> message should 
</I>&gt;<i> be saved to disk and a notification sent to the postmaster. A 
</I>&gt;<i> few years back 
</I>&gt;<i> I worked on several email gateways including X.400 to SMTP 
</I>&gt;<i> and our golden 
</I>&gt;<i> rule was that no message should ever be lost. Worse case it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be written 
</I>&gt;<i> to disk for later examination. Just my opinion.
</I>
Actually, I agree.  What I'd like is that any broken message be forwarded as a
plain text attachment to the postmaster.  I agree with the line &quot;Be liberal in
what you accept, and conservative in what you send&quot;.  Right now however
fetchmail simply drops broken email on the floor (or leaves it behind and
ignores it).


PLEASE - keep list traffic on the list.  Email sent directly to me may be
ignored utterly.
