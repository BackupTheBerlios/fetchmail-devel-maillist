I wouldn't think so.

</I>
I think it's fine to move stuff first.

&gt;<i> &gt; If the libntlm and mime64 contents are not used in the actual fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code, we can probably get rid of them.  On the other hand, README.NTLM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to go with the copies of the libntlm files that we're actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distributing, so should probably stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I figured we could delete README.NTLM along with libntlm. README.NTLM

</I>
Err, I'm confused here.  README.NTLM was distributed.  libntlm files were 
distributed (not in the libntlm directory).  Why delete README.NTLM?

&gt;<i> &gt; OPTIONS seems to belong in some sort of historical archive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless we plan on using it, I think we should delete it. Should we need
</I>&gt;<i> it, the file will always be in the older version on version control.
</I>
True.

&gt;<i> &gt; RFC/ could go in a document archive area (alongside OPTIONS?), or could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be considered redundant.  If deleted, I'd prefer to replace it with an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; HTML file of links to canonical locations of the same documents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think we could just get rid of it outright; I doesn't seem that
</I>&gt;<i> esr ever shipped it with tarballs, but rather only had it around for
</I>&gt;<i> personal use.
</I>
Actually he did at one point ship RFCs, though there was never any point in 
putting them in version control.

Anyway, I think there's value in tracking which RFCs are relevant, even if 
we don't keep the text of them ourselves.

&gt;<i> &gt; Isn't rh-config/ necessary for building the rpm?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't know. :)
</I>
Me either.
