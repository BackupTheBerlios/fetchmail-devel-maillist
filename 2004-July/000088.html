That free service has been as good as no service throughout those parts
of July when I had time to work on fetchmail.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no developer access SVN for me, and my local SVN refuses to switch to

</I>&gt;<i> At the moment my access seems fine.  I'm hoping to get back to work on

</I>
Yes, indeed it is SSH to cause my trouble, it crashed for me
last Thursday and I haven't been able to SSH into svn.berlios.de since,
neither straight with ssh nor via svn.

&gt;&gt;<i> It's now four days since I've filed &quot;still doesn't work&quot; -- add to that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the constant crashing of the data bases and a minor flaw in the SVN web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages with major effect (the URLs lack the trailing /trunk/) that hasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been addressed in weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm willing to forgive the /trunk thing.  The totally ignored support 
</I>&gt;<i> requests bother me, as does the extended inaccessability.
</I>
The forgotten /trunk/ makes an enormous difference - the difference
between checking out the tree once or checking out the tree for each and
every tag that it knows. That also contributes to server load. It's not
as though that was difficult to fix, two changes to a PHP document, see
<A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/source.php?page_url=/svn/index.php">http://developer.berlios.de/source.php?page_url=/svn/index.php</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> This isn't acceptable, how is development going to happen if we need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recover the data base frequently, are cut off the SVN for several days
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder how much of this is subversion not really being ready, and how 
</I>&gt;<i> much is Berlios not really being ready.
</I>
Reading the followups in this thread, it might be the svnserve stuff not
being ready, I'm not having any difficulties with the spamassassin or
subversion SVN services -- they don't use svn+ssh though but http.

And certainly BerliOS isn't ready if they're running a test phase
without anyone looking after the stuff.
