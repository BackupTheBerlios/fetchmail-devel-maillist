Sounds fine. Would the webpage stuff be released in tarballs?

Should I just move stuff now, and we can fix the scripts up as we use
them, or the other way around?

Alright, let's remember to put it in the web directory.

&gt;<i> I'm fine with dropping funny.html if nobody wants it in the new web page.

</I>
I'd say let's just create a 'www' or 'web' subdirectory in the trunk
now, and move the current stuff into it. We can then decide about
'funny.html' later.

&gt;<i> If the libntlm and mime64 contents are not used in the actual fetchmail 
</I>&gt;<i> code, we can probably get rid of them.  On the other hand, README.NTLM 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to go with the copies of the libntlm files that we're actually 
</I>&gt;<i> distributing, so should probably stay.
</I>
I figured we could delete README.NTLM along with libntlm. README.NTLM
was distributed with tarballs, whereas libtlm wasn't, at least that I
can tell.

&gt;<i> OPTIONS seems to belong in some sort of historical archive.
</I>
Unless we plan on using it, I think we should delete it. Should we need
it, the file will always be in the older version on version control.

&gt;<i> RFC/ could go in a document archive area (alongside OPTIONS?), or could be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered redundant.  If deleted, I'd prefer to replace it with an HTML 
</I>&gt;<i> file of links to canonical locations of the same documents.
</I>
I would think we could just get rid of it outright; I doesn't seem that
esr ever shipped it with tarballs, but rather only had it around for
personal use.

&gt;<i> Isn't rh-config/ necessary for building the rpm?
</I>
I wouldn't know. :)
