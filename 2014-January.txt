Subject: [fetchmail-devel] New Indonesian PO file for 'fetchmail' (version
	6.3.24.1)
Message-ID: <E1W7kLJ-0002RR-PI@duik.vrijschrift.org>

Hello, gentle maintainer.

This is a message from the Translation Project robot.

A revised PO file for textual domain 'fetchmail' has been submitted
by the Indonesian team of translators.  The file is available at:

    http://translationproject.org/latest/fetchmail/id.po

(We can arrange things so that in the future such files are automatically
e-mailed to you when they arrive.  Ask at the address below if you want this.)

All other PO files for your package are available in:

    http://translationproject.org/latest/fetchmail/

Please consider including all of these in your next release, whether
official or a pretest.

Whenever you have a new distribution with a new version number ready,
containing a newer POT file, please send the URL of that distribution
tarball to the address below.  The tarball may be just a pretest or a
snapshot, it does not even have to compile.  It is just used by the
translators when they need some extra translation context.

The following HTML page has been updated:

    http://translationproject.org/domain/fetchmail.html

If any question arises, please contact the translation coordinator.

Thank you for all your work,

                                The Translation Project robot, in the
                                name of your translation coordinator.
                                <coordinator at translationproject.org>
