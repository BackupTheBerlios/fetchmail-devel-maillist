<PRE>Greetings,

I have converted the fetchmail source code repository to Git[1] and moved  
it to a new host[2] in Norway.

[1] <A HREF="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</A>

[2] <A HREF="http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/">http://gitorious.org/fetchmail/</A>

The latter offers access for git clone (through Git and HTTP protocols)  
and an online repository browser, and the site runs free software.

I took the opportunity to rename branches a bit so as to adhere to Git  
conventions, and to make the most current software (BRANCH_6-3) the  
default checkout. Here's the list of correspondences between former SVN  
and current Git branches:

old SVN	new Git
--------------------
BRANCH_6-3  master (default branch, get this)
BRANCH_MAPI BRANCH_MAPI (development branch for MAPI integration, by  
Yang-Yan Li and Mojmir Svoboda)
trunk	    oldtrunk [3] (obsolete)
vendor*     vendor* (this was used for SVN module imports)
BRANCH_6-2  none (abandoned, branch converted to a tag)

The RELEASE_* and SNAPSHOT_* tags have been converted unchanged.

[3] This used to be a &quot;future&quot; version in the days of the early fetchmail  
6.3.n releases, but I stopped merging BRANCH_6-3 back intro trunk a long  
time ago because it was such a hassle in Subversion, and it's now  
outdated.	

Now, this means that:

- if you have uncommitted changes in the Subversion tree, update as soon  
as possible from SVN, and please contact me so we can arrange for a merge,  
possibly on your personal topic branch.

- mknod.org/svn/... URLs (links) will get outdated rather soon now,  
because Graham is about to decommission the service.


My deepest thanks go out to Graham Wilson (in Bcc:) who has voluntarily  
hosted the former Subversion repository for so many years, even after he  
quit co-maintaining fetchmail. It's been a good time with reliable service  
and it helped fetchmail development a lot. Thanks a million.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Best

Matthias Andree
