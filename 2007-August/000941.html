The (X)HTML -&gt; PDF part is the easy one, there are several automated
ways to achieve that, HTMLDOC being one of the easiest and with very
reasonable result.

Well, the MoinMoin wiki engine has a command-line tool to export static
HTML pages, Timo Sirainen is using that for snapshotting the Dovecot
Wiki contents. (Dovecot is a fast combined IMAP/POP3+SSL server
supporting mbox and Maildir, among other useful features.)

If the Wiki can't export to HTML, perhaps we can stick to using a set
of HTML pages - it's easier to control quality that way, too: we don't
need to eyeball it constantly to avoid other people posting stupid
things (such as enclosing mda placeholders in single quotes, injecting
into sendmail with variable destination address or something).
I'm not at all against the concept of a Wiki, but I think some kind of
&quot;peer review&quot; to avoid stupidities should be inherent once we deal with
security sensitive stuff.

The HTML document is in SVN, and I think we (that means my asking Graham
Wilson) can arrange commit access for you, or we can just revive the
BerliOS SVN stuff to host the web site.
