That would certainly make life easier.

If we go the wiki route then it would have to support (at least) 2
levels of users - admins (those you trust not to stuff up the
documentation) and everybody else (who have read only access).

Looking at the MoinMoin wiki documentation it does support that, plus
email notifications about page edits.

As for peer review, presumably such discussions could take place via
email, or even via Talk pages in the wiki?

&gt;<i> The HTML document is in SVN, and I think we (that means my asking Graham
</I>&gt;<i> Wilson) can arrange commit access for you, or we can just revive the
</I>&gt;<i> BerliOS SVN stuff to host the web site.
</I>
Well, getting up and running with SVN wouldn't be terribly difficult,
so that's always an option.

I'll admit that I'm looking for a solution that involves the minimal
amount of effort post-edit - I'm lazy but at least I know it ;)
