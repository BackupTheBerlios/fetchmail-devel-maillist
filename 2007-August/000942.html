Yes, older openssl s_client versions don't support as many protocols.

I know at least two very annoying bugs in older versions of fetchmail (I
don't recall the version numbers offhand, but it's in the NEWS file):

a. fetchmail not initializing the default certificate path in OpenSSL.

   Consequence: OpenSSL doesn't look at /etc/ssl/certs (or whatever the
   default path is).

   Workaround: use --sslcertpath /etc/ssl/certs

b. fetchmail complaining if --sslcertck is NOT given, but a matching
   --sslfingerprint is.

   AFAIK no workaround except short of filtering them out from the log.

Generally, there are two approaches of trusting the server's
certificate:

1. The canonical and recommended one: verify the recognized
   Certification Authority's signature on the server certificate (that
   works for major CAs as their certificates are usually shipped with
   the OS or available as add-on, for instance, in FreeBSD's ca-roots
   port).  /etc/ssl/certs contains certificates of CAs we trust
   (recognize) and is thus the configuration directory for the &quot;trusted
   CAs&quot;.

   That is the usual way of doing things, and reasonable sites using
   self-signed certificates provide their root CA certificates for
   download with a web browser and usually offer a phone number you can
   call to verify the fingerprint.
   At least that's how my former and current universities and the DFN
   (at a very coarse look, they provide the Internet backbone to German
   Universities) do that. As to the major freemailers I have acocunts
   with, they have their server certificates signed by Thawte, Verisign,
   Equifax or whoever else that up-to-date distributions usually
   recognize as trusted.

   I'm not sure if it's always possible to download the CA's certificate
   with openssl s_client.

2. The less durable one: verify the server's certificate instead.

   The recommendation of downloading the certificate and stuffing it
   into /etc/ssl/certs however is just a very cumbersome alternative of
   specifying the sslfingerprint which fetchmail already prints at -v
   verbose level. Let's not tell users to use openssl s_client to
   download certificates, but let's just point them to the
   sslfingerprint option and tell them that they need a recent fetchmail.

   The only technical difference is we're using a hash of the
   certificate and are currently relying on MD5, but I'm not aware that
   attacks are publicly known to generate a message with a specific hash
   in a reasonable amount of time.

Reason why I call 2 less durable is that CA certificates are usually
valid for five years or longer and to a certain extent managed by the
distributor, whereas server certificates often expire sooner, causing
issues once a year or so.

The wording above is perhaps not as clear as it could be if I revised
this text several times, but let's just see where it's unclear and
revise the critical parts. (And if that's going to evolve into a &quot;SSL
certificate management for fetchmail&quot; section, that's exactly what I'm
aiming at :-))

Best regards,
