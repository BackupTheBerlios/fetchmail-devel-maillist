Even 0.9.8e, the most recent, appears to be less than 100% - it won't
talk TLS to my domain host's IMAP/POP servers (but fetchmail will).

&gt;<i> Generally, there are two approaches of trusting the server's
</I>&gt;<i> certificate:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The canonical and recommended one: verify the recognized
</I>&gt;<i>    Certification Authority's signature on the server certificate (that
</I>&gt;<i>    works for major CAs as their certificates are usually shipped with
</I>&gt;<i>    the OS or available as add-on, for instance, in FreeBSD's ca-roots
</I>&gt;<i>    port).  /etc/ssl/certs contains certificates of CAs we trust
</I>&gt;<i>    (recognize) and is thus the configuration directory for the &quot;trusted
</I>&gt;<i>    CAs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    That is the usual way of doing things, and reasonable sites using
</I>&gt;<i>    self-signed certificates provide their root CA certificates for
</I>&gt;<i>    download with a web browser and usually offer a phone number you can
</I>&gt;<i>    call to verify the fingerprint.
</I>&gt;<i>    At least that's how my former and current universities and the DFN
</I>&gt;<i>    (at a very coarse look, they provide the Internet backbone to German
</I>&gt;<i>    Universities) do that.
</I>
Sadly, not all do.  I'll need to check, but I'm pretty sure one of my
current mail hosts uses a self signed certificate and no way of
downloading the CA certificate.

&gt;<i> 2. The less durable one: verify the server's certificate instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    The recommendation of downloading the certificate and stuffing it
</I>&gt;<i>    into /etc/ssl/certs however is just a very cumbersome alternative of
</I>&gt;<i>    specifying the sslfingerprint which fetchmail already prints at -v
</I>&gt;<i>    verbose level. Let's not tell users to use openssl s_client to
</I>&gt;<i>    download certificates, but let's just point them to the
</I>&gt;<i>    sslfingerprint option and tell them that they need a recent fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    The only technical difference is we're using a hash of the
</I>&gt;<i>    certificate and are currently relying on MD5, but I'm not aware that
</I>&gt;<i>    attacks are publicly known to generate a message with a specific hash
</I>&gt;<i>    in a reasonable amount of time.
</I>
I'm not aware of any easy way of generating a matching MD5, with valid
content, easily.

I suppose this raises a feature request then - when a certificate
fails to verify fetchmail should email the user specified in the poll
command (or the postmaster if multiple users are listed) to tell them.

&gt;<i> The wording above is perhaps not as clear as it could be if I revised
</I>&gt;<i> this text several times, but let's just see where it's unclear and
</I>&gt;<i> revise the critical parts. (And if that's going to evolve into a &quot;SSL
</I>&gt;<i> certificate management for fetchmail&quot; section, that's exactly what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> aiming at :-))
</I>
I don't have any problems understanding it, but then I have a
reasonable understanding of how SSL works :)  I'll come back to it
later and have another read to see if I can spot anything the average
user of fetchmail may not understand.
