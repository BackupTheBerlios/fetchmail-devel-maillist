<PRE>Recent events have persuaded me to get my proverbial finger out and
look at re-writing the FAQ to be more &quot;user friendly&quot; (and a little
more current).

With this in mind I'm soliciting feedback before I start :)

I'm considering splitting it into a number of pages, rather than the
monolithic page it is currently.  My current plan is that these would
cover (including the current areas):

1) (G) General, with an initial paragraph emphasising the need to use
the current version BEFORE asking for help with any problems

2) (B and F) Build problems and configuration file problems

3) (S and I) Problems downloading email

4) (T, D and M)) Problems passing email to your local mail system

5) (K) Proxies and Security (including SSL and SOCKS)

6) (R and H) Runtime problems

7) (C and M) Configuration problems and examples

8) (X and O) Everything else

Actually, I'd really like to get this into a Wiki because it means
that it's easier to work on it as I get time, plus it means that
others can easily add to/correct it as required.  I don't know if
Berlios has such functionality though (but I do know that pbwiki.com
is free).

Thoughts?
