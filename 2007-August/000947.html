<PRE>Quoting Matthias Andree:

&gt;&gt;<i> Most of the code is copied from imap.c. I inserted it into the generic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smtp code, so it could probably be used to deliver fetched mail via TLS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (if somebody ever wanted to do that).
</I>&gt;<i> Without looking at the code, is it possible to factor out the common
</I>&gt;<i> code into tls.c? Copy &amp; paste is always prone to leaving a bug in one
</I>
In general, you are right, of course. But the code is merely 60 lines 
and contains no heavy logic. The only SSL-specific stuff is a single 
call to SSLOpen(), the rest is more or less the same, with only some 
protocol specifics, esp. the rereading of the server's capabilities. I'm 
not sure if creating a new function that has to fulfill all the needs is 
that good, but I didn't look that close at the code. pop3.c contains 
just the same code, btw.

&gt;&gt;<i> You may notice that the patch removes adding our hostname to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ctl-&gt;domainlist for ODMR. I think this was plain wrong and bothered me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everytime I set up fetchmail with odmr. ODMR's default is a simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;ATRN&quot; without any arguments, which means &quot;fetch mail for all domains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> associated with the account&quot;, so we should stick with that.
</I>&gt;<i> If it's still possible to add it manually, I don't mind, although I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if that makes the patch suitable for inclusion into 6.3.
</I>
Sure, &quot;fetchdomains&quot; works as before. This is only the first hunk of the 
patch, so it could be easily removed.

&gt;&gt;<i> Additional notes:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The logging looks broken, with -v you get mixed ODMR and SMTP line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prefixes, but that's not related to my patch. Fixing this would could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably easily be done by changing smtp_mode and using it as an index
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to an array { &quot;SMTP&quot;, &quot;LMTP&quot;, &quot;ODMR&quot;, ... }.
</I>&gt;<i> Sunil knows that part of the code better than I do, but we can fix that
</I>&gt;<i> if we catch all occurrences and switch() statements related to
</I>&gt;<i> smtp_mode. (I wonder if that's a reasonable design anyways, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> loathe to change it in 6.3.)
</I>
AFAICS smtp_mode is used in logging, to get the char, or in comparisons 
with the macroes SMTP_MODE and LMTP_MODE. Should be not too hard to change.

&gt;&gt;<i> - What's with the formatting in odmr.c?? Mixed spaces and tabs, that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite horrible... if you don't mind, I'll clean that up (to whatever the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferred format is).
</I>&gt;<i> Well, my canonical style (I'm using vim) is an indentation width of 4
</I>&gt;<i> columns per level and using a tabwidth of 8, I.e. it's zero or more tabs
</I>
Oh. Ok. Any reason for that? (Not that I want to start a discussion on 
tabs vs. spaces.)
And how do you tell vim (which I happen to use, too) to use this style?

&gt;<i> Thanks for your efforts again.
</I>
Well, it's definitely not much compared to your efforts. So, many thanks 
back :)
