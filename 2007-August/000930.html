</I>&gt;<i> 3) (S and I) Problems downloading email

</I>&gt;<i> 4) (T, D and M)) Problems passing email to your local mail system
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) (K) Proxies and Security (including SSL and SOCKS)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7) (C and M) Configuration problems and examples
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8) (X and O) Everything else
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

Your help will be very welcome.

a. the split is a good idea, although I'm not sure about the &quot;everything
else&quot; part and if I'd split 3) and 4) - these are often intertwined, and
we'd have to make sure 6) doesn't contain parts that belong into 3 or 4.

b. Berlios have a Wiki, but I'm a bit concerned about the packaging process
- I can't seem to find an export static pages version, but haven't got the
time now to check the site documentation for BerliOS.

Generally speaking, any Wiki we use must be able to export the whole set of
pages as static documents with working links and with marginal to zero
effort - I want to ship the FAQ with the fetchmail package; pointing users
to online sites for documentation is not something I'm eager to do - sooner
or later someone will be trying to read that info while Berlios has some
sort of downtime... oops. Can pbwiki.com export HTML and PDF?

In the hope of further discussion on the &quot;how&quot;

Best regards
Matthias
