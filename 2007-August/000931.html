As long as it's pointers I think that's ok.  I'm trying to think of
how people approach the &quot;it's broken&quot; thought process.

As for &quot;everything else&quot;, I ran out of thoughts then :)

&gt;<i> b. Berlios have a Wiki, but I'm a bit concerned about the packaging process
</I>&gt;<i> - I can't seem to find an export static pages version, but haven't got the
</I>&gt;<i> time now to check the site documentation for BerliOS.
</I>
If it's accessible to the general public I'll have a look later
tonight (I should have an hour or so of time to myself :&gt;).

&gt;<i> Generally speaking, any Wiki we use must be able to export the whole set of
</I>&gt;<i> pages as static documents with working links and with marginal to zero
</I>&gt;<i> effort - I want to ship the FAQ with the fetchmail package; pointing users
</I>&gt;<i> to online sites for documentation is not something I'm eager to do - sooner
</I>&gt;<i> or later someone will be trying to read that info while Berlios has some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of downtime... oops. Can pbwiki.com export HTML and PDF?
</I>
I've no idea, but I'll have a look.  I do agree that making
assumptions about the future presence of a web site isn't good.

&gt;<i> In the hope of further discussion on the &quot;how&quot;
</I>
And, once the dust settles on this, I'd like to discuss the &quot;how&quot; of
re-working the small novel that is the man page.  That too I feel
needs a split and re-write - every other man page has the command line
options fairly close to the start, not a few dozen screens in.
