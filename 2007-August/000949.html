It is, and it works fine (from the same host) with fetchmail or
telnet.  I'll have a closer look tomorrow night, but I'm pretty sure
it's not a network problem :)

But lots of people won't/don't upgrade working systems if they don't
have to.  Heck, I've got a Mandrake 9.0 box that's barely been touched
since it was installed.

&gt;<i> As Matthias pointed out, the fingerprint is suitable for that.

I'm beginning to lean towards the view that the fingerprint is fine.
I do think however that failed certificate verification should be
handled the same way a failed password verification is - emailed
notification upon the first occurrence.
