<PRE>In the past there was a discussion with subject &quot;the message fetch should be 
completed before quitting&quot; on the fetchmail-user mailing list. It was clear the 
possibility of delivering incomplete mail messages when fetchmail is 
interrupted during a mail dispatching process. The issue doesn't lead to a loss 
of mail but produces some garbage in the maildir/mailbox (corrupted duplicated 
messages).

The problem is related to the use of the popen() function which doesn't 
provide the PID number of the MDA process. In this way is not possible to track 
properly the MDA process, i.e. to kill it in response to a quit command issued 
to fetchmail. Using the killpg() in response to the SIGINT (or SIGTERM) signal 
doesn't help because it kills the parent process before killing the child 
process.

Here is attached a first proposal to solve the issue, it seems to work on my 
system. As I don't know the fetchmail code I'm pretty sure there are some 
mistakes. First of all I don't understand the reason in the original 
release_sink() function there is no check of the return from popen(). For this 
reason I kept the same behavior with the new implementation. I also modified 
the SIGCHLD handler to reuse the waiting procedure for the forked MDA process.
