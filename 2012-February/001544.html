IPC isn't the issue here, but sorting the command line parsing and
&quot;which mailbox is active&quot; stuff out is, and that work would entail
getting rid of the &quot;no command line options permitted with running
daemon&quot;...

I'd presume it's an effort that might easily amount to two dozen hours
for someone moderately acquainted with the sources because it requires
adaptations in multiple parts of the code.

Also, fetchmail would need to lock individual mailboxes against
concurrent access -- but instead, it locks the whole process instead,
which is another obstacle.

I suppose fetchmail 8 might follow a different model compared to all
earlier versions, more modular, which would make such code additions
easier.  I haven't yet made a real plan, as fetchmail 7 would have to
happen first (with less radical changes), yet real life has gotten in
the way of things again.

&gt;<i> I suppose it's rarely needed so I don't think it's worth much efford; as
</I>&gt;<i> it's quite easy to have a different daemon per mailbox.
</I>
Plus you can stop the daemon, run fetchmail with &quot;-d0&quot; option (to defeat
the daemon mode) + the server's name (from the &quot;poll&quot; option) on the
command line, and then restart the original daemon.

No big deal from the command line, quite a big deal in code adaptation.

Best regards
