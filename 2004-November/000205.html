&gt;&gt;<i> Ripping code out of other software is harder to track WRT updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not really concerned as much about updates to an snprintf
</I>&gt;<i> implementation;
</I>
I am.

&gt;<i> I wouldn't think there would need to be much updating.
</I>
More than 4/5 of the snprintf replacements I've looked at were broken in
one way or another.

&gt;<i> I'm more concerned with adding a whole other project into the fetchmail
</I>&gt;<i> tarball.
</I>
We aren't doing that.

&gt;&gt;<i> What is the claim mutt had a &quot;good snprintf&quot; implementation based on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably some unfounded claim that I read somewhere else I suppose. If
</I>&gt;<i> you don't think the implementation is good, I'm fine with going with
</I>&gt;<i> something else.
</I>
I think the mutt implementation is too incomplete to be useful for
fetchmail.

&gt;<i> What about the implementation at [1]? The downside is that it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> support a number of conversion characters (f, e, E, g, G, lc, ls, n),
</I>&gt;<i> none of which we seem to use though. There are a few other small things
</I>&gt;<i> missing which I don't think we use (or will) either.
</I>
(from different mail)
&gt;<i> [1] <A HREF="http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/">http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/</A>
</I>
It doesn't support %n$ either, which is needed for internationalized
projects, so it, too, is out of the game. I haven't yet had the time to
look _closely_ at snprintfv.

</I>
I don't know, but I wouldn't want to break compatibility in a patchlevel
or minot update. If we drop all the cruft,  we need to call it 7.0 - and
we'd instead need to get out 6.2.6 or 6.3.0 soon.  We can change
requirements an drop compatibility cruft for a later major version.

&gt;<i> According to the FreeBSD manpage,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      the snprintf() and vsnprintf()
</I>&gt;<i>      functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (`ISO C99'').
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be reasonable simply to expect a decent O/S to have these functions
</I>&gt;<i> now? I don't know if SunOS 4.1 has snprintf or not,
</I>
It doesn't, but SunOS older than 5.7 (IIRC) isn't supported by the
vendor any more.

&gt;<i> If there is a free-standing external snprintf library, then we could just
</I>&gt;<i> point people at it and tell them to install it first if it's needed.
</I>
The replacements I've looked at all assumed to be packaged as integral
part of another application.
