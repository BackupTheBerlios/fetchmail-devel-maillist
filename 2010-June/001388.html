Hi Rainer,

thanks a lot.

Is that the final submission to be expected, or do you still want to  
polish some bits of it?

I'm asking because I plan to use the code in a new minor release (6.4 or  
6.5, not yet sure how I'll name it) rather than 6.3.X,
which means I may need to tweak a few ends (because I already purged old  
compatibility cruft from that tree) and that might conflict with your  
future changes.  If you want to modify it, I'll just push the patch to a  
new branch in Gitorious so it's there for the public, but hold off with  
merging until around June 20, so that I don't need to re-merge later.

You also mentioned Disconnected IMAP earlier, is that a project you are  
still pursuing and/or want to submit later?
If so, what's the status?  I absolutely do not mean to urge here, this is  
only so that we can align planning a bit.

Best regards
Matthias
