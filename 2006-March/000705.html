<PRE>Quoting from Matthias Andree's mail on Fri, Mar 17, 2006:
&gt;<i> &gt; fetchmail, by default, uses first IMAP and then POP3 (protocol auto).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should we deprecate this &quot;protocol&quot; in fetchmail proper so we can
</I>&gt;<i> remove it in 6.4.0?  I have a strong itch to do just that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Somebody got any objections?
</I>
What should be the new default protocol be then, imap or pop3?

Yes, protocol auto should be removed as it is confusing.

&gt;<i> &gt; - If your mailserver is delivering to multiple folders, choose IMAP.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - If you want to download all mails and not leave a copy on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server, choose IMAP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In --all --nokeep setups, POP3 is usually simpler - any particular
</I>&gt;<i> reason why you suggest IMAP here?
</I>
If the connection to the mailserver breaks for any reason, mails get
downloaded again in POP3. The only POP3 setup which downloads mails
exactly once and deletes the downloaded mails is:

poll mailserver
    protocol pop3
    uidl         # required for unique download
    no fetchall  # required for unique download
    no keep
    flush        # to directly delete mails downloaded before the previous socket error

Unfortunately, this setup is not documented in the FAQ anywhere. I was
hoping to cover it in the proposed FAQ section:

    C#. Ok, I choose POP3. What next?

Due to the overhead of &quot;uidl&quot;, I would prefer suggesting imap here.

&gt;<i> &gt; - If you intend to keep mails on the server, check if your server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   supports UIDL. If it does, choose POP3 and enable the &quot;uidl&quot; option.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   With POP3 and UIDL, it is even possible to access the mailbox
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   through multiple e-mail clients without affecting fetchmail.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - If you intend to keep mails on the server, but your server does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   support UIDL, choose IMAP. However, you should not access the
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Make that &quot;MUST NOT&quot; access...
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> &gt;   mailbox through other e-mail clients as fetchmail will not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   able to download all new mails.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - If you are having a slow connection to the mailserver and/or expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   frequent socket errors from the mailserver, choose IMAP and do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   leave a copy on the mailserver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This, too, is something POP3+UIDL should handle.
</I>
On a slow connection, I feel that the download and delete setup works
the best. Yes, POP3+UIDL can definitely handle it, but I think that
IMAP can do it in the minimum amount of traffic. However, I think the
wording of my point is wrong. Here is how it should be:

==========================================================================
- If you are having a slow connection to the mailserver and/or expect
  frequent socket errors from the mailserver, you should consider not
  leaving a copy on the mailserver. This is because leaving a copy on
  the mailserver adds a small but significant amount of traffic from
  the mailserver in every poll.

  If you still prefer leaving a copy on the mailserver, choose POP3
  with the &quot;uidl&quot; option. If you prefer not to leave a copy on the
  mailserver, choose IMAP.
==========================================================================

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My basic idea is: say we have u UIDLs stored, and the server has m
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; messages. Then, send &quot;UIDL&quot; u+1 &quot;UIDL&quot; u+2 ... &quot;UIDL&quot; m pipelined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (non-blocking) (or, on future RANGE capable POP3 servers, &quot;UIDL&quot; u+1 &quot;-&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; m), and if ANY seen message is in that range, do slow UIDL. No binary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; search with many round trips. Of course, this needs to track deletions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; properly and if another client client deletes messages, needs to back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; down and fetch the whole list. Perhaps sanity checking the last known
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; UIDL helps detecting third-party deletions on the assumption that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; likelyhood of the server recycling a UID is low.
</I>
This sanity checking part is indeed correct.

Pipelining will, of course, require a lot of work. Also, getting the
full UIDL list might actually turn out to be a lot faster than
pipelining if there are many new mails.

I still have reservations about fetching the whole UIDL list
immediately after detecting the mismatch. If it is postponed to the
next poll, it should be ok.
