Sure, even OE supports it. But still, the default operation of all
client I know is &quot;download and delete&quot;, so UIDL is not used. The major
use of fetchmail is being some kind of MUA &quot;proxy&quot; (not in technical
sense), so it should (by default) behave like a (default) MUA.

Yet another MUA feature. :)

How are you going to do this? Adding a third column to the fetchids file?

He should not, but often enough he has to. I prefer to have full control
instead of having to work around some program's magic. But I understand
that my view is surely not the same as some usual user's. I hope it's
possible to satisfy both user groups.

&gt;<i> Server-side tracking is a constant source of troubles with respect to

</I>
Not that I care much about that, but server-vs-client side tracking is
not only an implementional difference, but also a functional one, so I'd
be reluctant to rip out SST. Some broken servers should not be a reason
to abandon a feature.

&gt;<i> (insecure, removed with RFC-1460 in 1993), &quot;LAST&quot; (removed with RFC-1725
</I>
Usually I agree to get rid of old stuff, most of the time they are
kludges with incosistent behaviour and are replaced by a superior
mechanism. But that's not true for LAST, which has no 100% (in POP3).
And it's still supported by modern servers like Dovecot.

&gt;<i> talking RFC-1939 (POP3)/1734 (AUTH)/2449 (TLS)/2222 (SASL).
</I>
But things like ntlm/msn authentication and pop3s/imaps are still supported?
