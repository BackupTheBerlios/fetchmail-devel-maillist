<PRE>Quoting from Matthias Andree's mail on Tue, Mar 07, 2006:
&gt;<i> what should we do WRT fastuidl?  We seem to need sanity checks to disable
</I>&gt;<i> the fastuidl search for servers such as Fr?d?ric's.
</I>
One option is to change the default to a lower value from the current
value of 10. The lowest practical value is 2, which will use linear
search in alternate polls.

A default of 4 should be alright. It will use linear search in the
first poll, followed by binary search in the next three polls,
followed by linear search in the next poll, and so on.

Other solutions are also possible. For example, keeping a map of UID
and message number in memory (with corrections for mails deleted after
logout). Then, when there is a mismatch in the message number expected
and the message number received from the remote server for any one
mail, a linear search should be forced in the next(*) poll. This would
be equivalent to setting fastuidl to 2 if this mismatch happens in
every poll.

Note that Frederic has claimed that messages with low UID never get
downloaded. This is only partially correct. In his case, messages with
low UID never get downloaded whenever a binary search is performed.
However, a linear search is performed once in every ten polls
(starting with the first poll) and these messages which were missed
out earlier will get downloaded in this poll with linear search.

(*) There is a reason why a linear search should not be forced in this
poll after detecting the mismatch. The same reason applies as to why
fastuidl cannot be disabled for servers such as that of Frederic.

The fastuidl and the fetchsizelimit options have been developed
keeping in mind a large mailbox with thousands of mails being polled
over a slow dialup line which is prone to frequent disconnection.
fetchmail used to previously download all UIDs and all mail sizes
right at the start of the poll. Thus, the amount of data transferred
even before the start of the download of the first mail used to be
huge. For example, if there are 2000 mails in the folder, the data
transferred would be around 110kb (assuming a UID size of 40b) for
POP3. Assuming that an average mail size is 5kb, this would mean that
data equivalent to 22 mails have been downloaded even before
downloading the first mail.

The fetchsizelimit option delays the downloading of the mail sizes.
The fastuidl option delays the downloading of UIDs when doing binary
search. Thus, the first (new) mail is downloaded pretty fast.

Forcing linear search on this poll after detecting the mismatch will
effectively disable fastuidl if this mismatch is detected on every
poll.
