</I>
Probably, although this might become a tagged format so it's extensible.
The current UID implementation is very inefficient and needs to be
revised.

&gt;<i> &gt; The user should not need to care about protocol details before he runs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> He should not, but often enough he has to. I prefer to have full control
</I>&gt;<i> instead of having to work around some program's magic. But I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that my view is surely not the same as some usual user's. I hope it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible to satisfy both user groups.
</I>
Magic only if nothing is configured explicitly.

&gt;<i> &gt; Server-side tracking is a constant source of troubles with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interrupted connections, software faults, aborts, reboots, any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things, and relying on POP3 server state beyond UIDL just doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well, so everything will be switched to client-side tracking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I care much about that, but server-vs-client side tracking is
</I>&gt;<i> not only an implementional difference, but also a functional one, so I'd
</I>&gt;<i> be reluctant to rip out SST. Some broken servers should not be a reason
</I>&gt;<i> to abandon a feature.
</I>
fetchmail's foremost task is to fetch every message, exactly once. This
cannot be achieved with server-side tracking.

&gt;<i> &gt; (insecure, removed with RFC-1460 in 1993), &quot;LAST&quot; (removed with RFC-1725
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Usually I agree to get rid of old stuff, most of the time they are
</I>&gt;<i> kludges with incosistent behaviour and are replaced by a superior
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism. But that's not true for LAST, which has no 100% (in POP3).
</I>&gt;<i> And it's still supported by modern servers like Dovecot.
</I>
LAST is a nonstandard extension. Perhaps I'll keep it in as fallback for
--keep on servers that don't talk UIDL, but IF it keeps in, only as last
resort.

&gt;<i> &gt; talking RFC-1939 (POP3)/1734 (AUTH)/2449 (TLS)/2222 (SASL).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But things like ntlm/msn authentication and pop3s/imaps are still supported?
</I>
Probably yes, modulo the NTLM bugs that got reported.
