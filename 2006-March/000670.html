&gt;<i> A good imap server can handle two email clients accessing the same
</I>&gt;<i> mailbox and reports the mails deleted by one email client correctly to
</I>&gt;<i> the other email client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, fetchmail cannot handle this unexpected deletion of mails.
</I>&gt;<i> This is because fetchmail caches which mails are new and the size of
</I>&gt;<i> those new mails. This caching is required to give a better
</I>&gt;<i> performance, but leads to unexpected results when another email client
</I>&gt;<i> is writing to the same mailbox:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - An old mail could be delivered instead of a recent mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - fetchmail passes the wrong size to the SMTP server in the MAIL FROM:
</I>&gt;<i>   command. If the SMTP server has size restrictions, a wrong mail will
</I>&gt;<i>   get rejected!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;fetchmail -vv&quot; reports that there is a mismatch in the expected and
</I>&gt;<i>   received message sizes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This patch causes fetchmail to quit the poll if there is a mismatch in
</I>&gt;<i> the count of mails being deleted.
</I>
Well, OK. We'll take this as a safety measure, but I maintain that the
real solution is to properly cache the mailbox state and update it as
untagged responses come in.

I've merged the patch onto branches/BRANCH_6-3 for the nonce, and will
update the trunk from there after the 6.3.3 release.

&gt;<i> This patch also handles servers which do not report RECENT on EXPUNGE
</I>&gt;<i>in a better way. Now, recentcount is counted down on EXPUNGE of each
</I>&gt;<i>mail along with count. This way, recentcount need not be reset to zero
</I>&gt;<i>if the server does not give a new report of RECENT mails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This patch has been tested by running two fetchmails on the same
</I>&gt;<i> mailbox!

&gt;&gt;<i> It would be better to update the cache properly (watching out for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventual iterator variables that need to be decremented, too) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue. From our own cached flags we should be able to deduce if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expunged message was recent or not. If we don't know and the server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expunged a different mail.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, before you go delve into the code and hack away, take a step back
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the blackboard to see the whole picture: the RECENT flags are just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crap if several clients are accessing the mailbox. What happens to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RECENT count if we reselect the mailbox? Can we actually use it? Do we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to check \Seen flags instead, for lack of UID support in IMAP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I plan to implement the recentcount as a difference between EXISTS
</I>&gt;<i> count at end and beginning of poll. I can work on that only after this
</I>&gt;<i> patch is accepted. At that time, your point will also get implemented.
</I>
Sounds good.

&gt;<i> fetchmail uses the RECENT only to decide
</I>&gt;<i> a) whether to repoll at the end of mailbox poll
</I>&gt;<i> b) whether to come out of IDLE (or NOOP look) while waiting for new
</I>&gt;<i> mail.
</I>
&gt;<i> The UID code is not going to help here as this would require getting
</I>&gt;<i> the full list of UIDs at the end of mailbox poll (and every minute,
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;idle&quot;). The RECENT code is much cleaner as imap servers reports
</I>&gt;<i> the RECENT count consistently and correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The RECENT count is not being used to decide which mails are new. It
</I>&gt;<i> is only being used at the end of the poll or while idling for new
</I>&gt;<i> mail.
</I>
OK.
