<PRE>Quoting from Matthias Andree's mail on Thu, Jul 23, 2009:
&gt;<i> &gt; ====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Case 1: After fetchmail has sent the initial MAIL FROM: to the SMTP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server/invoked the MDA with %F substitution:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am assuming here that the SMTP server/MDA is doing a DNS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lookup/basic spam testing on the sender address.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, in the SMTP server case, fetchmail is waiting for a response from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the server after sending the initial MAIL FROM: while the SMTP server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is doing the DNS lookup/basic spam testing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the MDA case, fetchmail goes ahead with popen() and starts writing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the body to the MDA. As the MDA is still doing the DNS lookup/basic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spam testing and has not yet started reading the body, the pipe buffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will get full and fetchmail will get blocked on an fwrite() later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While fetchmail is blocked, the POP3 mailserver is waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fetchmail to read the entire mail body.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that the write() timeout for the POP3 mailserver may be shorter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the read() timeout. This means that the POP3 mailserver is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely to timeout faster if it finds that the body is not getting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drained at all in a reasonable amount of time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Case 2: After fetchmail has sent the entire mail to the SMTP server/MDA:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here, the remote mailserver is waiting for a command from fetchmail,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while fetchmail is waiting for a response from the SMTP server/exit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code from the MDA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As mentioned above, the read() timeout may be longer for the POP3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mailserver and so it may not mind waiting for the next command.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ====================================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if I want to design fetchmail around guesses if read() or  
</I>&gt;<i> write() timeouts on the server are set differently.
</I>
What I mean to say is that Case 1 above must be occurring more
frequently than reported. Hence, it should be tackled first. Of
course, I could be wrong and so Case 2 should be tackled first.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a. queue downloaded messages before handing them off for delivery. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; avoids timeouts that originate in the SMTP/LMTP server or MDA that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fetchmail forwards to.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This should work. Of course, fetchmail will have to work entirely with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UIDs as it will have to reconnect later and mark delivered mails for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deletion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup. That's what I want to do anyways in the next after-6.3.N releases (if  
</I>&gt;<i> I'll call them 6.4 or 6.5 or 7.0, I'll decide later).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we'd have to polish the existing UID patches for IMAP to support  
</I>&gt;<i> UIDVALIDITY (not a major issue, once you detect UIDVALIDITY changes, you  
</I>&gt;<i> discard all stored UIDs) - OTOH if fetchmail deals cleanly with the  
</I>&gt;<i> existing \Seen and \Deleted flags, we don't even need that for IMAP. I  
</I>&gt;<i> need to check the IMAP4r1 transaction model though.
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Fixing 2 is sort of a requisite for solving 1 in way a or c - we need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; track more state. This does entail changing the .fetchids format as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; discussed in 2006, but the UID parser appeared very tolerant even at  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; time, so that an extension would be possible and backwards compatible. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would feel more comfortable checking that again, but I think I checked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thoroughly in 2006 already. Even if we must change the .fetchids
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; format/layout, I'm open to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, changing the .fetchids format is anyway a must. If you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorporate the UID parser, it will be great. If I remember correctly,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;incorporate&quot; here.
</I>
I mean, please merge my UID parser code patch in fetchmail, if it is
still suitable.

&gt;<i> &gt; the UID parser also had an option to mark bad mails. This would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used in such cases where there is a repeated delivery failure on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same mail. Once a certain bad count is reached, fetchmail will stop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempting to download the mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think fetchmail has such a feature in the baseline code. The  
</I>&gt;<i> internal uid data structure is:
