Hi Sunil,

the first patch is easy, accepted, thank you.


As so the second (with _split and caching), I wonder if it's the right
approach. It looks a bit as though we're curing the symptoms instead of
the cause.  The cause is a buffer too small to handle the response, and
the cure would be to make the buffer dynamic and possibly resize it if
we don't get a \r?\n in it.


A dynamic buffer could also save us the strcpy(argbuf, buf) copy which,
IMO, is quite wasteful.


What I propose is to have three branches, details below the list:

- one for 6.3.X (new name to be devised), for a final release and
possibly later critical/security fixes

- one for a new 6.4.X or 7.X.X branch (master) where such fixes as the
IMAP search ranges can be made

- one for the future 7.X.X or 8.X.X branch (next) for radical changes
such as the C++ migration and major structural changes.


Details:

1 - create a side branch from master for 6.3.X, revert the SSLv2
removal, fix STARTTLS timeouts (the code is almost completed) and clear
up the MD5 mess.  Release 6.3.20 from the side branch.


2 - master advances to 7.0.X, sporting feature removals from the &quot;next&quot;
branch (7.0.0-alpha2) such as IMAP2, POP2, SSLv2, support for pre-SUSv3
systems and other cleanups, but not the C++ migration.  Revamp the
socket handling, using dynamic buffers, use Rainer's patch to speed up
POP3 UID handling with PATRICIA data structures (this gives us the edge
over getmail ;-))

  - The SSL handling is not done properly, but needs to be.
Look at the _ssl_ctx and all that stuff, we're wasting humongous amounts
of static memory (FD_SETSIZE is 1024 on my system, and sizeof(SSL) is
512, so we waste 512 kibiB of RAM just for SSL support) just because the
socket code sticks to simple ints, rather than using a proper structure
of our own.



3 - next advances to 8.0.X including a C++ migration, with major overhaul:

  - I have started converting the code (on the &quot;next&quot; branch in Git) to
C++ with Standard Template Library and Boost.  Boost is, for the biggest
part, a headers-only library, so it doesn't create additional run-time
dependencies, and it is peer-reviewed by the C++ gurus and often the
basis for future standards &lt;<A HREF="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</A>&gt;. IMAPCapa* is an
example of how compact the code is.

    C++ features such as the string type, or STL containers such as
vector, map, set, list/deque/stack; or Boost functions for intervals,
will greatly simplify the code.  As will exceptions.


  - I plan to support UID-based fetches in IMAP too, so we can fetch
from READ-ONLY folders and need no longer tamper with \Seen flags.

    In that case, UIDs are strictly monotonically increasing (unless
UIDVALIDITY has changed), so we know for certain where we need to start
the SEARCH or FETCH, too, so we avoid empty fetches. (Note Boost's
Interval type!)


  - I plan to support pipelined operation for common protocols to avoid
the roundtrip delays incurred through lock-step behaviour.  It's not
possible everywhere (for instance, when doing a binary search for POP3
UIDLs), but should help maxing out the wires or WiFi even in a single
thread once we get to downloading.


  - I want to clean up the code to an extent where we can ultimately
fetch from several accounts in parallel.


Opinions, comments, remarks, concerns, ideas are solicited.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Matthias
