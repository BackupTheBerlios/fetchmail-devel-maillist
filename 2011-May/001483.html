&gt;<i> Hi Matthias,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ----- Original Message -----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As so the second (with _split and caching), I wonder if it's the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach. It looks a bit as though we're curing the symptoms instead of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cause.  The cause is a buffer too small to handle the response, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cure would be to make the buffer dynamic and possibly resize it if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we don't get a \r?\n in it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A dynamic buffer could also save us the strcpy(argbuf, buf) copy which,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMO, is quite wasteful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I had given a thought for implementing dynamic buffers. However, some issues came to my mind:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - What if the buffer required is very long? For example, an extreme response like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP&lt; * SEARCH 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 999995 999996 999997 99998 99999 100000
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> will require a dynamic buffer of size 575k. Is it okay to allocate such a huge buffer?
</I>
Possibly yes, although some limit would be in order.

Do we really need to optimize 6.3.X with obtrusive changes?  This will
make merging between master and next harder.

&gt;<i> - Who will free the buffer? Obviously, it will have to be statically allocated in order to free it later.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - How long will it remain? Is it safe to free it immediately on the next call?
</I>
&gt;<i> In short, without a proper memory manager, it may not be safe to just allocate a dynamic buffer of such a huge size.
</I>
I'll sidestep these for now.

&gt;<i> Note that the strcpy(argbuf, buf) can still be avoided by directly passing argbuf (if available) to gen_recv().
</I>
OK. It's a separate microoptimization anyways, not worth discussing.
Someone will do it ;-)

&gt;<i> Also, note that that patch is a bug fix. The current method range search for UNSEEN mails is too slow for huge mailboxes. So, a fix for this issue is required for 6.3.X.
</I>
It may be painful, but if it works, it's not a bug unless the
documentation promises otherwise (which it does not).

For a 25,000 message mailbox with 1% unseen, the amount of SEARCH
transactions seems to be reasonably low.  I think POP3 + uidl + keep in
that situation would burn something between 3 and 30 seconds CPU time on
a Phenom II 2.5 GHz CPU w/ GCC 4.5 compiled code while chewing on UIDLs.
The fix was contributed by Rainer Weikusat and is in the next branch and
in 7.0.0-alpha2.

&gt;&gt;<i> What I propose is to have three branches, details below the list:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - one for 6.3.X (new name to be devised), for a final release and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibly later critical/security fixes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - one for a new 6.4.X or 7.X.X branch (master) where such fixes as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMAP search ranges can be made
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, it is necessary to fix the range search issue in 6.3.X itself as fetchmail is now unusable with IMAP when the mailbox is huge and keep is on.
</I>
Try POP3 UIDL on a mailbox with the same message (86000) count and let
me know if you still think IMAP is &quot;unusable&quot;.  Hint: check what Rainer
and I have been benchmarking when he contributed the PATRICIA
implementation.  I've avoided it in 6.3.X because I have portability
concerns.

I will take your patch in spite of my concerns, and test it.

I suggest that you check the manual pages of strlcpy and strlcat, these
are alternatives to snprintf(buf, siz, &quot;%s%s&quot;, s1, s2).  glibc is one of
the major distros lacking it, but we ship replacements.  Also note that
&lt;strings.h&gt; has strcasecmp and, more usefully, strncasecmp, and we have
our replacements for OSes lacking them, too.
