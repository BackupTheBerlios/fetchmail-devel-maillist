<PRE>100%, and it's use relies on people having the very latest version for
IMAP support (from your comment below).

History on the -users mailing list suggests that we really need to
make it easy for people to solve these problems.  If it's simple
enough to provide all the required information from within fetchmail
then that's got to make their lives (and by extension mine :&gt;) easier.

If openssl's client support was better established then I'd probably
agree with you though.

&gt;<i> But it looks like the openssl people are working on it: 0.9.8e also
</I>&gt;<i> contains STARTTLS support for imap (and even handles smtp properly).
</I>
Just tried it with one provider and it works, useful.

It does however assume that everybody is using at least 0.9.8e :)  I
suppose I'm mostly concerned about the poor souls who're using RPM
based distributions.  It isn't always possible to upgrade one package
without upgrading dozens of others - something people who're just
trying to get one package working may not want to/be able to do.
