&gt;<i> I'm considering a general solution that doesn't require such an analysis,  
</I>&gt;<i> but solves all of the issues at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WRT tracking the DELE/QUIT races in POP3, I am wondering about the  
</I>&gt;<i> handling of the QUIT. Can we see a difference between &quot;server hasn't  
</I>&gt;<i> received QUIT&quot; and &quot;we haven't seen the answer&quot;? In other words, will the  
</I>&gt;<i> server's TCP stack hand the QUIT command to the server application  
</I>&gt;<i> software even if TCP couldn't send the ACK? I think it will, because the  
</I>&gt;<i> ACK itself needn't be ACKed and the server often won't care if we don't  
</I>&gt;<i> see the +OK after QUIT...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other option is top track UIDs with &quot;to be deleted&quot; and &quot;deleted, QUIT  
</I>&gt;<i> +OK pending&quot; and &quot;deleted, QUIT acknowledged&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;QUIT acknowledged&quot; is easy, we don't save that state per UID, but just  
</I>&gt;<i> drop the corresponding UID as the server will do the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;to be deleted&quot; means we're positively sure that the transaction was  
</I>&gt;<i> rolled back (because we haven't sent the QUIT command) - we need a  
</I>&gt;<i> workaround server option though, because some servers can be configured to  
</I>&gt;<i> spoil the protocol dangerously and commit DELEtes on loss of connection  
</I>&gt;<i> unless there's a RSET. We can assume the server won't reassign the UID  
</I>&gt;<i> until the next cycle (*)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;deleted, QUIT +OK pending&quot; is for your borderline case, we've sent the  
</I>&gt;<i> QUIT to the TCP/IP stack but haven't seen the +OK response. If we see more  
</I>&gt;<i> than half of the UIDs marked QUIT +OK pending in the next cycle, we'll  
</I>&gt;<i> mark them &quot;to be deleted&quot;, if it's less than half, we'll forget them and  
</I>&gt;<i> re-fetch. The other option is to hash a subset of whitespace-normalized  
</I>&gt;<i> message headers (Received, Message-ID, perhaps others, making sure to  
</I>&gt;<i> avoid X-Status or other mutable headers) to accompany the UID. We could  
</I>&gt;<i> hash headers as they pass by in forwarding and only re-fetch them in your  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we send QUIT but don't see +OK&quot; case if we don't trust the UID. I wonder  
</I>&gt;<i> if we should do that.
</I>
Well, the 'UID_OLD_DELETED' mark mentioned above was meant to address these
cases.

&gt;<i> WRT getting stuck on one message, we could record message UIDs and mark  
</I>&gt;<i> them as &quot;fetch attempted before&quot;, perhaps with a counter. We'd set this  
</I>&gt;<i> state if we ever send a TOP or RETR for a new message and keep this state  
</I>&gt;<i> for the next poll cycle. This would be less than &quot;seen&quot;. On the next poll  
</I>&gt;<i> cycle, we'll fetch new messages before those marked &quot;fetch attempted  
</I>&gt;<i> before&quot;. This would allow new mail to be fetched even if we get stuck on  
</I>&gt;<i> particular messages through server, fetchmail, or MTA/MDA bugs. If we add  
</I>&gt;<i> a counter, we can mark a message &quot;broken&quot; if the counter exceeds a  
</I>&gt;<i> threshold and give up on it without deleting it, and request manual  
</I>&gt;<i> intervention from the postmaster (in multidrop) or addressee (in  
</I>&gt;<i> singledrop).
</I>
The 'errcount' field mentioned above was meant for this purpose.
