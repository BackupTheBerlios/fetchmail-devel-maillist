Errm, I think we're saying the same thing.

If you have a normal user account:
  =&gt; you can run fetchmail, and this is just fine and dandy

If you are logged in as root:
  =&gt; you can switch to a normal user instead and run fetchmail (recommended)
  =&gt; you can run fetchmail as root: stupid, but not as stupid as many other
     things you could do as root.

In the last case, all I'm saying is that if the system administrator is that
stupid, then making fetchmail *force* them to run as a non-root user is
pretty pointless, as they are almost certainly doing worse things anyway.

I can only see value if you want to engage in a blame-shifting exercise:
i.e. if a user runs fetchmail as root, AND a security hole in fetchmail
exists, AND it is exploited by a hostile pop3 or smtp server, THEN you can
say &quot;don't blame us, we told you not do run it as root&quot;.

But you can achieve that just in the documentation, and indeed the GPL's &quot;no
warranty&quot; clause is very clear.

In any case - there are lots of Unix commands which don't *need* to be run
as root, and which could put you at risk if you do, but they still let you.
What about 'telnet' and 'ssh' for example?

Regards,

Brian.
