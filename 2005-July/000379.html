I think that firstly fetchmail's configuration file should be made much more
logical and self-consistent.

I've had difficultly wrapping my head around this before; if I
understand correctly, there are:
- global options
- per-server options
- per-account options

but (a) these are not clearly demarked, and (b) there seems to be little
logic as to which option is where. Yet try to use an option in the wrong
place at it bombs out.

For example, &quot;ssl&quot; and &quot;sslcertck&quot; are per-account options; but &quot;protocol&quot;
and the multidrop options like &quot;dns&quot; and &quot;aka&quot; are per-server options. This
has caused me a great deal of grief in the past trying to make a valid
configuration. Once I discovered '--configdump' I ended up using that to
work out what went where.

Furthermore, some things can be set on the command-line using flags, e.g.
&quot;-S&quot; for &quot;smtphost&quot; which makes it look like a global setting, when in fact
it is a per-account setting.

ISTM that a sensible approach would be to have an inheritance tree: e.g.

  global props =&gt; server props =&gt; account props

A setting can be put at whichever level makes sense, and overridden at a
lower level. For example, the &quot;sslcertpath&quot; option almost certainly makes
sense at a global level; you will very often use the same set of ssl certs
across all servers. Or you might want to specify it for a server, and have
it used by all accounts you fetch from there. Being able to set 'smtphost'
globally would also be useful in many cases.

If we're going that route, I don't see why the hierarchy has to be fixed,
because ultimately all that's going to happen is separate POP3/IMAP
connections for each account. For example, a very simple configuration (one
account) might have

  server+account

The next level would be

  global =&gt; server+account

and a more complex one might have

  global =&gt; servergroup =&gt; server =&gt; account

One other thing. I would like to be able to name my accounts; at the moment
if I have

skip pop3.example.com
  .. account 1 ..

skip pop3.example.com
  .. account 2 ..

then I don't have a way of polling one or other account individually. My
workaround is to try and find two different hostnames which map to the same
IP address (ugh).

Now, I'm not going to assert what this config *should* look like, but here's
an example which at least meets my goals:

---- 8&lt; ----------------------------------------
poll_interval: 0
sslcertpath: /etc/ssl/certs
smtphost: 127.0.0.1
uidl: true
to: brian

(
  account: test1
  smtphost: smtp.example.net
  hostname: pop3.example.com
  remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">foo at example.com</A>
  password: xyzzy
  active: false
  protocol: pop3
  to: *
)

(
  hostname: pop.example.net
  protocol: pop3
  (
    account: test2
    remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">bar at example.net</A>
    password: wibble
    ssl: true
  )
  ( 
    account: test3
    remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">baz at example.net</A>
    password: bibble
  )
)
---- 8&lt; ----------------------------------------

That is:

   fetchmail test2

would find 'account: test2', and use the settings directly associated with
that account (remote, password, ssl), plus the ones in the enclosing levels
(hostname, protocol; poll_interval, sslcertpath, smtphost, uidl, to). Then
any settings on the command line acting as global defaults above that, and
finally there would be hard-coded defaults (e.g. active: true)

I hope this makes sense. Please, nobody suggest XML :-)

Regards,

Brian.

P.S. Perhaps Python-style indenting would be more readable?

---- 8&lt; ----------------------------------------
poll_interval: 0
sslcertpath: /etc/ssl/certs
smtphost: 127.0.0.1
uidl: true
to: brian

account: test1
  smtphost: smtp.example.net
  hostname: pop3.example.com
  remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">foo at example.com</A>
  password: xyzzy
  active: false
  protocol: pop3
  to: *

group: foo
  hostname: pop.example.net
  protocol: pop3
  account: test2
    remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">bar at example.net</A>
    password: wibble
    ssl: true
  account: test3
    remote: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/fetchmail-devel">baz at example.net</A>
    password: bibble

---- 8&lt; ----------------------------------------

(By naming the group, 'fetchmail foo' would be the same as 'fetchmail test2
test3')
