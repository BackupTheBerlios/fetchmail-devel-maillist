The third obvious choice is to bounce the mail (the same as would happen if
the original sender made a direct SMTP connection to the local SMTP server
to deliver that message, rather than going via a POP3 mailbox)

I don't see any point in trying to make an invalid mail into some
pseudo-valid form for delivery to a postmaster. Why should fetchmail's
policy take precedence over the local SMTP server's policy?

By all means have a 'test' mode which never deletes mail. Once users are
happy that everything is OK, then do whatever the SMTP server says.

Having said that, generating bounces to forged return addresses is
considered somewhat impolite these days.

Regards,

Brian.
