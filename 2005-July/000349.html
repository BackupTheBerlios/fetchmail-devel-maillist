Hannes,

it's been a long time since you'd suggested your changes and offered the
man page patch.

I have gratefully merged your excellent work on the fetchmail.man
page, to appear in the next fetchmail release.

The log formatting changes you've suggested are more intrusive and I am
begging your indulgence while we must shelve the log formatting changes
for the nonce, for one reason is that we'll need to focus the next few
releases on catching up with bug fixes, and for another is that cosmetic
changes without attached patches don't rank very high in our list of
priorities, with the severely limited time that maintainers have to look
into this.

I understand that even cosmetic changes may be highly desirable or
useful, but there are unfortunately more important changes (such as UID
handling) down the pipe that need to be addressed earlier.

I hope that's OK. I have achived and marked important your message that
I'm replying to, so I can easily come back to this issue later.

Thanks again for your manual page contribution, much appreciated!

Kind regards,

-- 
Matthias Andree
