So tell Exchange not to do that.
Why would a client want to cater for servers who tamper with data? It's
the MIME boundary today and the sender address tomorrow. And why would a
client want to use such a server at all?

&gt;<i> It rewrites the boundary differently (using a different randomly
</I>&gt;<i> generated string) for each IMAP request.  Because fetchmail downloads
</I>&gt;<i> the headers and body separately, this results in a different boundary
</I>&gt;<i> in the Content-Type header than in the message body.

...

[bug fixing for Lotus insanity transferred to MS Exchange?]
&gt;<i> I don't suppose I can convince you to reconsider?  (I somehow doubt

</I>
Well, if I had time at my hands, I might offer to fix this for money.
Given that 6.3.9 has been delayed for weeks already, I'd rather not make
any offers in that direction.

I'm aware this isn't too helpful, but I don't see it as my foremost
interest to work around server bugs - especially not if the changes to
code would have to be rather intrusive.

Sorry.

Best regards
Matthias
