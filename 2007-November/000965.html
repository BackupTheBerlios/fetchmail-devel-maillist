Yes, I agree Exchange is broken here.  Unfortunately, I don't have any
control over the mail server.  I have contacted my IT support contacts
about this problem with the server, but I haven't heard anything back
from them yet.  (And I don't have high hopes that they'll be willing
or able to fix this problem anyway.)

Sure, I completely understand.  I've switched to POP3 for now, which
shouldn't have the problem.

If I have the time later, I might create a patch for this on my own.
Would you consider accepting the patch if I came up with one?  It
looks like I should probably just create a new method struct identical
to the current &quot;imap&quot; one, but with a single fetch method that gets
everthing, and fetch_body set to NULL.  Is that the preferred
approach, or did you have something else in mind?
