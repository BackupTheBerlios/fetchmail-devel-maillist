OK, this is now definitely the correct version. Sorry for the small bug 
in my first version, and thanks for committing the two fixes to svn. I 
think this should solve my problems.

You might have a look at the attached patch. It removes the (completely 
unnecessary) recursion in free_str_list. So it reduces stack usage and 
avoids possible problems with very long lists. Furthermore I slightly 
changed the interface and replaced the pointer to a pointer to the first 
list element by just a pointer to the first list element. I think, this 
is cleaner; the only difference is that it is now in some cases 
necessary to set the pointer to NULL afterwards, but this is already 
done at many locations anyway.

 &gt; Perhaps keeping all spam mail on the server isn't the best idea then?

But since I fetch the mails from two PCs (at home and at work), I have 
to leave them on the server. Maybe I should delete mails from the server 
more frequently. But I have to do this manually, because fetchmail does 
not support to keep the mails only for X days or to keep only the latest 
X mails (the later would be very easy to implement, but according to the 
fetchmail FAQ it will not be implemented due to political reasons). And 
an automatic cron job is no alternative, because, in this case I cannot 
be sure, that fetchmail got all the mails before the cron job deletes 
them. The deletion should be done _after_ fetchmail delivered the mails 
locally, ideally within the same pop3 session.
