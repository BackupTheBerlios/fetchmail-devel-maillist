<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I have a problem with fetchmail, which occurs every once in a while (and
also happened with older versions of fetchmail). I use fetchmail in
daemon mode (started from my KDE startup script when I log in) to poll
two mail servers.
Sometimes when I log in the .fetchids file is very short, it contains
only very few uids. And therefore fetchmail loads down very many old
mails. And since I get very much spam, this is very much, often several
thousand mails. My first thought was, that probably fetchmail is killed
in a bad moment during writing the .fetchids by system shutdown. This is
one possibility, but I had a look into the code and found a bug, which
also could cause this problem.

In the function uid_swap_lists (in uid.c) there is this code:
     if (ctl-&gt;newsaved)
     {
	/* old state of mailbox may now be irrelevant */
	if (outlevel &gt;= O_DEBUG)
	    report(stdout, GT_(&quot;swapping UID lists\n&quot;));
	free_str_list(&amp;ctl-&gt;oldsaved);
	ctl-&gt;oldsaved = ctl-&gt;newsaved;
	ctl-&gt;newsaved = (struct idlist *) NULL;
     }

So first the old oldsaved list is freed, and then it is overwritten with
the newsaved list. If the TERM signal arrives during the free_str_list,
an incomplete oldsaved list will be saved to .fetchids. And since
free_str_list is implemented by a recursion, it really shortens the list
beginning at the end (BTW I do not know, why this is implemented by a
recursion rather then by a loop. If there are many messages on the
server this could lead to a really deep recursion with the possibility
of a stack overflow).
IMHO the correct solution would be:
     if (ctl-&gt;newsaved)
     {
	struct idlist *temp;
	/* old state of mailbox may now be irrelevant */
	if (outlevel &gt;= O_DEBUG)
	    report(stdout, GT_(&quot;swapping UID lists\n&quot;));
	temp = ctrl-&gt;oldsaved;
	ctl-&gt;oldsaved = ctl-&gt;newsaved;
	ctl-&gt;newsaved = (struct idlist *) NULL;
	free_str_list(&amp;ctl-&gt;oldsaved);
     }


An additional good idea would be not to overwrite the old idfile, but
write to new idfile (e.g. ~/.fetchids-new), and after completion rename
the file (e.g. &quot;rename(&quot;~/.fetchids-new&quot;, &quot;~/.fetchids&quot;);&quot; or similar).
Since there is a comment in the code &quot;FIXME: do not overwrite the old
idfile&quot; I assume that you already planned such change and I wonder, why
you did not implement it. I think, it is a very easy change, it is
probably just about 3 or 4 additional lines; if you want, I can provide
you a patch.


Here is the information you require (according to the FAQ) in a bug report:
1. Linux 2.6.10 (but the problem occurred also with older versions)
2. fetchmail_6.2.5-12_i386.deb
3. I do not see a greeting when logging into the pop3 server (not
relevant for the problem anyway).
4. Exim 4.34
5. -d 600
5.
This is fetchmail release 6.2.5+NTLM+SDPS+SSL+NLS
Fallback MDA: (none)
Linux pc235 2.6.10 #1 Mon Dec 27 10:43:40 CET 2004 i686 GNU/Linux
