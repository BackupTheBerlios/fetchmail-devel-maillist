</I>In my case, that account (which is not The Postmaster) received 82 mails
for the last 6 hours and they ended up at the secretary that must deal
with 80% of spam from various addresses every day. I double check that
account from time to time and I salvage a few mails every month. Sending
a mail to an account where the user spend most of his/her time deleting
spams is unreliable at best :-).

With the limited experience I gained from our small particular net, I
think it is best to let the mail go unchanged if fetchmail can extract
enough information to determine the next route. It could also add a
valid X-Envelope-To if none was found but, as you said in a previous
post, anything beyond that would be risky...

Now, other e-mail processing configurations may have requirements I
don't see. So, feel free to tell me about it. It would help me to have a
clear picture of what fetchmail must deal with if I start changing the
code, preferably before I do it :-).
